    "## **Notebook Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "This notebook evaluates and visualizes the performance of a clinical trial-patient matching system (\"trial_matches.json\"), comparing system-assigned trial suitability verdicts against curated gold-standard labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Steps and Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Data Loading**\n",
    "- Loads:\n",
    "  - **Gold/reference** patient-trial pairs and scores from `test.tsv`.\n",
    "  - **Patient queries** and **trial corpus** from `queries.jsonl` and `corpus.jsonl`.\n",
    "  - **Trial matches** (detailed matching outputs) from `matched/trial_matches.json` (contains verdicts, reasoning about inclusion/exclusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Flatten & Normalize Trial Matches**\n",
    "- Iterates through `trial_matches.json` to **flatten nested structures** into a DataFrame:\n",
    "  - Columns include: `query-id`, `corpus-id`, model trial verdict (`match_verdict`), reasoning, inclusion/exclusion flags, and detailed eligibility explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Merge Gold with System Predictions**\n",
    "- Merges gold-standard pairs (`df_tsv`) with matched verdicts (`df_trial_matches`) by query and trial IDs.\n",
    "- Ensures **all gold pairs are present**, filling unmatched ones with NaN for later filtering/checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Label Harmonization**\n",
    "- Maps system verdicts (“STRONG MATCH”, “POSSIBLE MATCH”, “WEAK MATCH”, “UNSUITABLE”) into numeric label space {0, 1, 2} for comparison:\n",
    "  - 2: Highly likely (\"STRONG MATCH\" or \"POSSIBLE MATCH\")\n",
    "  - 1: Would consider (\"WEAK MATCH\")\n",
    "  - 0: Would not refer (\"UNSUITABLE\")\n",
    "- Aligns ground-truth labels from gold file into the same space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Evaluation**\n",
    "- **Omissions:** Reports count/samples of pairs where there is no system verdict (excluded from scoring).\n",
    "- **Metrics:**\n",
    "  - Computes **confusion matrix** (tabular and heatmap) to visualize agreement.\n",
    "  - Calculates **macro-averaged F1 score** and displays a full classification report (precision/recall per label).\n",
    "- **Visualization:** Plots the confusion matrix with Seaborn for a clear model performance summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Inspection & Quality Control**\n",
    "- Provides options to display merged/evaluated DataFrame (with explanations/reasoning), as well as any omitted/missing rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Display/Output**\n",
    "- Configures pandas for wide displays, allowing direct inspection of large slices of merged data and reasoning fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Outputs**\n",
    "- **Metrics for Model QA:** Confusion matrix, macro F1, precision/recall for each decision level.\n",
    "- **Visualization:** Color-coded confusion matrix heatmap for rapid error pattern assessment.\n",
    "- **Inspection:** Full merged DataFrame can be displayed, supporting qualitative analysis via system reasoning and verdicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intended Use**\n",
    "- **Model validation and debugging:** Evaluate system-patient-to-trial assignment quality.\n",
    "- **Insight into errors:** Directly reveals misclassifications and their reasoning by exploring DataFrame rows.\n",
    "- **Transparent reporting:** Well-suited for sharing system strengths and weaknesses with stakeholders or during clinical IR system development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technical/Architectural Notes**\n",
    "- **Robust merging:** Ensures all reference pairs are considered, not just those found by the matcher.\n",
    "- **Extendable:** Can be easily fit for other datasets or more granular scoring/justification analysis.\n",
    "- **User-friendly:** Designed for rapid exploratory analysis, including straightforward displays for both summary and raw data."

However, the effect of LED has never been examined in overweight patients with IHD. Several studies have shown that patients with IHD have a beneficial effect of exercise training regarding mortality and reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. A Norwegian group has shown that aerobic interval training results in the biggest increase in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). A high VO2max is correlated to decreased mortality in patients with IHD. In conclusion, weight loss and exercise are known strategies in preventing progression of IHD and development of type 2 diabetes in these patients, however a head-to-head comparison of the two methods has never been made and it is unknown which intervention is the most effective in improving cardiovascular risk profile.

Patients with arterial insufficiency are known to have poor circulation in their lower legs and feet leading to various complications such as swelling and painful legs and reduced healing of injuries. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be defined as a narrowing of the arteries reducing blood flow. It is most commonly due to atherosclerosis, and has associations with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Its incidence is estimated at 7-14% in the general population, increasing with age to about 20% in the over-seventies. It is associated with effects on mobility, skin condition and quality of life. Symptoms include pain in the legs on walking (intermittent claudication), pain at rest (particularly at night), gangrene, and limb loss. Management of PAD is based on encouraging exercise, and modification of risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. In patients with PAD, exercise tolerance is often limited. Severe symptoms and disease can be treated via such as balloon angioplasty, stenting or surgical bypass, but these procedures have risk. There also remains a percentage of patients who are not suitable for revascularisation, and have only a few options such as amputation available to them. Some trials have shown that increasing the blood flow in the legs over time using medical devices (intermittent pneumatic compression, muscle stimulators), in addition to maximal medical and surgical therapy, can increase claudication distance, absolute walking distance, decrease rest pain, and reduce amputation rates. In the investigators unit it has become apparent that there are an increasing number of medical devices available for circulatory support, either as an inpatient, out-patient, or a member of the general public. The supporting evidence for these is variable in scientific and clinical content or relevance, and requires clinical trials to evaluate further. Revitive activates the pumping action of leg muscles by providing electrical muscle stimulation to cause foot muscle contraction and relaxation which squeezes blood back towards the heart, improving circulation. The investigators wish to evaluate whether NMES using this device has the same beneficial effects in patients with critical limb ischaemia.'}</td>\n",

Group 1 included patients with only chorea, while patients with arthritis and carditis were involved in Group 2 and patients with only carditis were included in the Group 3. A group with only arthritis was not established since the patients with isolated arthritis are usually followed up at primary and secondary healthcare facilities rather than referring those patients to our tertiary healthcare center. Venous Blood Sampling Following tests were analyzed using venous blood samples drawn from patients and healthy control subjects; complete blood count, ESR, nephelometric CRP and immune turbidimetric hsCRP, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C and HDL-C levels by enzymatic coloxrimetric method and FSH and LH and total testosterone (for male subjects) and estradiol (for female subjects)levels by chemoluminescent assey. Plasma and serum samples were drawn for adiponectin, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. Blood samples were drawn for analyzing acute phase reactants at Day 2nd , 5th , 10th and 15th days and at 8 week in order to evaluate response to the treatment, while blood samples were simultaneously drawn for analyzing adiponectin, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Plasma Adiponectin Measurement Venous blood samples were added into the centrifuge tubes with EDTA, they were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4 °C for 15 minutes and the resultant plasma samples were stored at -80 °C. Plasma samples were diluted (1:300) as directed by the instruction for use of the kit, before the analysis was conducted. Samples taken for plasma adiponectin levels were analyzed using Human Adiponectin ELISA, High Sensitivity kit (BioVendor Research and Diagnostic Products, Modrice, Czech Republic) with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. Results were expressed as ng/ml and converted into µg/ml via dividing them by 1000. Serum TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 Measurements The venous blood samples were added into centrifuge tubes not containing anticoagulant for measuring serum TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4 °C for 15 minutes and the resultant serum samples were stored at -80 °C. Samples taken for measuring serum TNF-, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were analyzed with ELISA method using Human TNF-α ELISA, Human IL-6 ELISA, Human IL-8/NAP-1 ELISA kits (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). Absorbance was read at 450 nm. Results were expressed as pg/ml.'}</td>\n",

These studies will employ a magnetic resonance imaging sequence with synchronous motion-sensitizing gradients to map propagating shear waves in the muscle. The technique will assess the mechanical properties of the muscle and its tension distribution. Specifically, the study can be divided into three specific aims. Aim 1: Optimize MRE methods of acquisition and analysis for the assessment of muscle, including electromechanical drivers, data acquisition techniques, and methods for image analysis. Advanced techniques for very rapid MRE assessment of muscle will continue to be developed. Aim 2: Validate the MRE assessment of muscle properties and tension with phantom, ex-vivo muscle, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) techniques. Finite Element Analysis will be performed by using both phantom and bovine muscles to better correlate MRE wave-length findings as function of muscle properties, tension and fiber architecture. Aim 3: Study In Vivo Normal and Abnormal Muscle. The MRE technique will be applied in vivo to provide elastographic images of abnormal muscle with known disorders. The patient groups chosen for study are each important in their own right, and furnish unique information across the spectrum of muscular disease and dysfunction. Groups to be studied include individuals with new onset of spasticity following an ischemic, hemispheric stroke, disuse atrophy as a result of immobilization, metabolic (hyperthyroid) myopathy and myofascial pain for trigger point identification. The overall hypothesis of this work is that will bring benefits to both basic research and clinical care.', 'detailed_description': ''}</td>\n",

Additionally, while the patient is not listed as taking any prescribed medications, the record does not explicitly state that the patient is not taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or statins, which are the study medications of interest. Lastly, there is no information provided about the patient's primary care physician being part of the study population.

However, there is no clear evidence of ischemic heart disease, despite symptoms suggestive of cardiac issues (e.g., episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain, nausea, diaphoresis, mild dyspnea). The EKG shows nonspecific changes, and there is no confirmed diagnosis of ischemic heart disease provided. Additionally, there is no mention of the patient signing an informed consent, which is a critical inclusion criterion. Therefore, the patient does not meet all the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial.   \n",
       "106   The patient's summary provides some relevant information, such as the absence of known diabetes mellitus, denial of family history of heart disease, and symptoms suggestive of stable ischemic heart disease (episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain). However, critical information is missing to fully assess the patient's eligibility against all inclusion criteria. The patient's BMI, which is crucial for determining eligibility, is not provided. Additionally, there is no information on the patient's fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c levels, ejection fraction, FEV1, detailed physical examination findings, vital signs, organ function, exercise test results, AV block status, history of cancer, physical activity level, or recent weight changes. Without this information, it is impossible to confirm whether the patient meets all the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. Therefore, the verdict is undetermined due to the lack of critical information necessary for a comprehensive assessment.   \n",

The patient summary does not provide TSH, T3, or T4 levels, which are crucial for determining eligibility based on the trial's defined diagnostic standards. Without this information, it is impossible to confirm whether the patient meets the inclusion criteria for hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism. The presence of symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism (prolonged fatigue, hair loss, change in voice, weight gain, and cold intolerance) and a physical examination finding of an anterior cervical mass are noted, but these alone do not meet the trial's specific diagnostic criteria.

Weight loss using a low energy diet (LED, 800 - 1000 kcal/day) has been shown to induce a considerable weight loss in obese but otherwise healthy patients and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in these subjects. Additionally, a British study using a very low energy diet (VLED, 600 kcal/day) to obtain weight loss, has shown that subject with diagnosed type 2 diabetes had their blood glucose normalized after an 8 week VLED. However, the effect of LED has never been examined in overweight patients with IHD. Several studies have shown that patients with IHD have a beneficial effect of exercise training regarding mortality and reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. A Norwegian group has shown that aerobic interval training results in the biggest increase in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). A high VO2max is correlated to decreased mortality in patients with IHD. In conclusion, weight loss and exercise are known strategies in preventing progression of IHD and development of type 2 diabetes in these patients, however a head-to-head comparison of the two methods has never been made and it is unknown which intervention is the most effective in improving cardiovascular risk profile. Furthermore, several mechanisms behind the known beneficial effect of these interventions are unknown.'}   \n",

Patients with arterial insufficiency are known to have poor circulation in their lower legs and feet leading to various complications such as swelling and painful legs and reduced healing of injuries. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be defined as a narrowing of the arteries reducing blood flow. It is most commonly due to atherosclerosis, and has associations with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Its incidence is estimated at 7-14% in the general population, increasing with age to about 20% in the over-seventies. It is associated with effects on mobility, skin condition and quality of life. Symptoms include pain in the legs on walking (intermittent claudication), pain at rest (particularly at night), gangrene, and limb loss. Management of PAD is based on encouraging exercise, and modification of risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. In patients with PAD, exercise tolerance is often limited. Severe symptoms and disease can be treated via such as balloon angioplasty, stenting or surgical bypass, but these procedures have risk. There also remains a percentage of patients who are not suitable for revascularisation, and have only a few options such as amputation available to them. Some trials have shown that increasing the blood flow in the legs over time using medical devices (intermittent pneumatic compression, muscle stimulators), in addition to maximal medical and surgical therapy, can increase claudication distance, absolute walking distance, decrease rest pain, and reduce amputation rates. In the investigators unit it has become apparent that there are an increasing number of medical devices available for circulatory support, either as an inpatient, out-patient, or a member of the general public. The supporting evidence for these is variable in scientific and clinical content or relevance, and requires clinical trials to evaluate further. Revitive activates the pumping action of leg muscles by providing electrical muscle stimulation to cause foot muscle contraction and relaxation which squeezes blood back towards the heart, improving circulation. The investigators wish to evaluate whether NMES using this device has the same beneficial effects in patients with critical limb ischaemia.'}   \n",

The study protocol was approved by Ethics Committee of Medical Faculty, Eskişehir Osmangazi University (Decision No. 41 dated June 4, 2008). Parents of study participants were informed about the aim and the method of the study and written consents were obtained. For the study subjects, diagnosis of ARF was made according to the Modified Jones criteria (4) and appropriate treatment was started. Patients were divided into three groups by clinical findings. Group 1 included patients with only chorea, while patients with arthritis and carditis were involved in Group 2 and patients with only carditis were included in the Group 3. A group with only arthritis was not established since the patients with isolated arthritis are usually followed up at primary and secondary healthcare facilities rather than referring those patients to our tertiary healthcare center. Venous Blood Sampling Following tests were analyzed using venous blood samples drawn from patients and healthy control subjects; complete blood count, ESR, nephelometric CRP and immune turbidimetric hsCRP, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C and HDL-C levels by enzymatic coloxrimetric method and FSH and LH and total testosterone (for male subjects) and estradiol (for female subjects)levels by chemoluminescent assey. Plasma and serum samples were drawn for adiponectin, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. Blood samples were drawn for analyzing acute phase reactants at Day 2nd , 5th , 10th and 15th days and at 8 week in order to evaluate response to the treatment, while blood samples were simultaneously drawn for analyzing adiponectin, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Plasma Adiponectin Measurement Venous blood samples were added into the centrifuge tubes with EDTA, they were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4 °C for 15 minutes and the resultant plasma samples were stored at -80 °C. Plasma samples were diluted (1:300) as directed by the instruction for use of the kit, before the analysis was conducted. Samples taken for plasma adiponectin levels were analyzed using Human Adiponectin ELISA, High Sensitivity kit (BioVendor Research and Diagnostic Products, Modrice, Czech Republic) with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. Results were expressed as ng/ml and converted into µg/ml via dividing them by 1000.

These studies will employ a magnetic resonance imaging sequence with synchronous motion-sensitizing gradients to map propagating shear waves in the muscle. The technique will assess the mechanical properties of the muscle and its tension distribution. Specifically, the study can be divided into three specific aims. Aim 1: Optimize MRE methods of acquisition and analysis for the assessment of muscle, including electromechanical drivers, data acquisition techniques, and methods for image analysis. Advanced techniques for very rapid MRE assessment of muscle will continue to be developed. Aim 2: Validate the MRE assessment of muscle properties and tension with phantom, ex-vivo muscle, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) techniques. Finite Element Analysis will be performed by using both phantom and bovine muscles to better correlate MRE wave-length findings as function of muscle properties, tension and fiber architecture. Aim 3: Study In Vivo Normal and Abnormal Muscle. The MRE technique will be applied in vivo to provide elastographic images of abnormal muscle with known disorders. The patient groups chosen for study are each important in their own right, and furnish unique information across the spectrum of muscular disease and dysfunction. Groups to be studied include individuals with new onset of spasticity following an ischemic, hemispheric stroke, disuse atrophy as a result of immobilization, metabolic (hyperthyroid) myopathy and myofascial pain for trigger point identification. The overall hypothesis of this work is that will bring benefits to both basic research and clinical care.', 'detailed_description': ''}   \n",

These children are at increased risk for a wide range of social, psychological, physical, and achievement-related problems. Thus, the potential benefits of effective and highly transportable depression prevention programs are enormous. The Penn Resiliency Program (PRP) is a school-based group intervention that teaches cognitive behavioral and social problem-solving skills to young adolescents. This study will examine the effectiveness of PRP in preventing symptoms of depression and anxiety among a group of young adolescents. Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: adolescent only PRP, adolescent plus parent PRP, or no treatment control. In adolescent PRP, students will be taught cognitive and behavioral problem solving skills by school counselors and teachers. Parents in PRP will be taught to model and reinforce the skills taught in the adolescent program. Participants in the adolescent program will attend twelve 90-minute group sessions after school hours. Participants in the parent program will attend six 90-minute group sessions. Adolescent participants will attend booster sessions twice per year for 2 to 3 years after the initial treatment has ended. Parents will attend one booster session per year during the follow-up phase. Adolescents' depression and anxiety symptoms will be assessed through questionnaires at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month intervals for 2 to 3 years following the intervention. Adolescents will also complete questionnaires about their coping behaviors, feelings of hopelessness, and several other outcomes related to depression and anxiety in adolescence. Data will be collected once per year from parents and teachers. Adolescent participants will also be assessed for depression and anxiety disorders each year the child is in the study.'}   \n",

The cohort is an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and is a partnership among two minority institutions (Jackson State University and Tougaloo College), one majority institution in Jackson, Mississippi (the University of Mississippi Medical Center), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).', 'detailed_description': 'BACKGROUND: Heart disease and stroke remain the first and third leading killers of all Americans, with a disproportionate share of the burden borne by African Americans. Cardiovascular and total mortality are known to be higher among African Americans than among white Americans, but reasons for these differences remain unknown. In addition, well-documented declines in CVD and coronary disease mortality in the past three decades have not been shared equally between blacks and whites. Age-adjusted death rates were identical in both groups in 1980, but by 1994 the rate among African Americans was 14% higher than in whites. The race difference in magnitude of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality is greater in women than men and higher in middle age, such that CHD deaths tend to occur in blacks about 5 years earlier than in whites. Excess cerebrovascular disease incidence and mortality in blacks are even greater than the differences noted in CHD. Cardiovascular mortality rates in Mississippi, which are approximately 25% higher than the United States average, are the highest in the United States for all race-sex groups. Age-adjusted CVD mortality for African American women in Mississippi was 75% higher than in white women in 1994. The mortality for African American men was 47% higher than in white men. Prevalence of hypertension is nearly 40% greater in African Americans than in whites and its sequelae are more frequent and severe. Evidence of target organ damage such as renal failure and left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in black than white hypertensives at comparable levels of blood pressure. Many risk factors are also more common in blacks, including diabetes, high serum lipoprotein levels [Lp(a)], and obesity (in women). Other risk factors, such as elevated total cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and heavy cigarette smoking, are more common in whites. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) initial examination, which began in the fall of 2000, included men and women ages 35 to 84, and took 3 years to complete. The coordinating center, located at Jackson State University, collects and analyzes data. The undergraduate training center at Tougaloo College offers coursework to students in public health and epidemiology, and provides practical experience in health research to prepare them for potential careers in these fields. The exam center at the University of Mississippi is responsible for recruiting participants and conducting examinations. JHS is uniquely positioned to answer key questions regarding the excess burden of CVD among African Americans and to address the critical shortage of minority investigators trained in epidemiology and prevention. These questions will be answered by incorporating state-of-the-art physiologic and epidemiologic methods in a stable population-based minority cohort, providing research experience, and building research capabilities at minority institutions. The Second Exam began in September 2005.'}</td>\n",

In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are then removed, and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body, either through the same needle or through a second needle placed in the other arm. 10. Bone marrow sampling to study the disease. A small amount of marrow from the hipbone is drawn (aspirated) through a needle. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia or light sedation. 11.

Patients with disease of unknown or incomplete genetic characterization will be studied with hopes of contributing to the identification of specific genes responsible for disease. Studies of fresh cells, cell lines and tissue samples will be performed to help characterize the patient s syndrome as well as to test the efficacy of genetic correction when available. The outcome we seek is to improve our knowledge of the molecular basis, clinical presentation and evolution of primary immunodeficiency diseases and to collaborate to maintain or improve the health status of our patients.

It is of unknown etiology and was first described in Japan in 1967. The illness carries an acute mortality rate of approximately 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control defines Kawasaki Syndrome as a fever lasting five or more days for which no explanation can be found. Patients also must have at least four of the following symptoms: bilateral conjunctival infection; infected or fissured lips, pharynx, or a 'strawberry tongue'; erythema of the palms or soles, or edema of the hands or feet, or generalized or periungual desquamation; rash; and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery aneurysms occur in 15-20 percent of children with the illness. In the past, no treatment had been shown to be effective in preventing this complication. Investigators in Japan began to use IVGG to reduce the aneurysm formation. Preliminary results showing the usefulness of this therapy led to a multicenter trial in Japan in which 400 mg/kg/day of IVGG were given for five days to children also receiving aspirin for the condition. Results of the Japanese trial showed that within 29 days of the onset of the disease, coronary artery dilatation had developed in 42 percent of the aspirin-treated children and in 15 percent of the IVGG and aspirin-treated children. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Phase I was randomized, unblinded and stratified by age, sex, and center. Subjects were randomized to receive either 80 to 120 mg/kg/day of aspirin through day 14 of illness, subsequently reduced to 3 to 5 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose or to 400 mg/kg/day of intravenous gamma globulin for four consecutive days plus aspirin as above. Primary endpoint was formation of aneurysms as demonstrated by echocardiograms. Follow-up was for 7 weeks. Phase II of the trial began enrollment of 549 patients in May 1986 and ended enrollment in November 1989. Two hundred and seventy six children were randomized to receive 400 mg/kg of intravenous gamma globulin over four consecutive days. Two hundred and seventy-three received a single infusion of 2 g/kg of body weight over 10 hours. Both treatment groups received 100 mg/kg of aspirin per day through day 14 and then 3 to 5 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome variables were the presence or absence of coronary artery abnormalities evident at the two week and seven week follow-up examinations. Echocardiograms were obtained for 523 children at the two week visit and for 520 children at the seven week visit.'}</td>\n",

The immune repertoire, being the sum of T and B lymphocytes in a body at any given time, is both a snapshot and a historical record of a person's immune function. Thanks to the power of next-generation sequencing (NGS), massively parallel sequencing of the B cell and T cell receptors suddenly becomes plausible, and opens a door for many creative approaches to study immune related diseases. The ultimate goal of this project is to use both the NGS deep sequencing and immune repertoire experiment to perform Graves' disease sub-group genetic fine mapping, and to identify Graves' disease-specific T cell and B cell receptors. Furthermore, using the immune repertoire approach, investigators want to study the critical epitopes of thyroid auto-antigens, and to delineate the pathophysiological steps in various disease stages and in various sub-groups.

According to the patient summary under \"DEMOGRAPHICS,\" the patient is described as a \"58-year-old African-American woman.\" This directly matches the inclusion criterion, indicating that the patient does indeed meet the requirement. Since there are no other criteria to evaluate and this one is clearly met, the patient is eligible for the trial based on the information provided.   \n",

The patient summary indicates that the patient is a 67-year-old woman, which falls within the specified age range. Additionally, the patient has undergone a procedure involving the right femoral artery (cardiac catheterization) and presents with symptoms and signs (pulsatile mass, loss of distal pulses, bruit) related to the femoral artery, suggesting that a clinical evaluation of the femoral artery is relevant to her care. Although the summary does not explicitly mention a clinical ultrasound evaluation, the context implies involvement of the femoral artery, which aligns with the trial's criteria.

The patient's symptoms, including productive cough, chest pain, fever, chills, and worsening cough, along with physical examination findings such as expiratory wheezing, decreased breath sounds, and egophony in the left lower lung field, are consistent with a respiratory tract infection. Specifically, the presentation is suggestive of mild community-acquired pneumonia, given the symptoms and physical findings. Although the patient summary does not explicitly state a diagnosis of one of the listed conditions (acute tracheitis, acute tracheobronchitis, acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, acute tonsillopharyngitis, acute bronchitis, mild community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis), the clinical description aligns closely with mild community-acquired pneumonia, which is among the included conditions. Therefore, based on the information provided, the patient appears to meet all the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial.   \n",
       "3109  The trial inclusion criteria specify that patients must be greater than or equal to 14 years of age, meet the criteria for community-acquired pneumonia, and meet the criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient is 31 years old, which satisfies the age criterion. The patient's symptoms, such as productive cough, chest pain, fever, chills, and worsening condition after initial improvement, along with physical examination findings like expiratory wheezing, decreased breath sounds, and egophony in the left lower lung field, are consistent with pneumonia. Although the patient summary does not explicitly state \"community-acquired pneumonia\" or \"healthcare-associated pneumonia,\" the context suggests community acquisition given the patient lives with a wife who had similar symptoms recently, implying a possible household transmission. There is no clear indication of healthcare-associated acquisition, but the lack of information about recent hospitalization or healthcare exposure does not definitively rule out healthcare-associated pneumonia either. However, given the symptoms and the recent similar illness in a household member, it is reasonable to consider the pneumonia as community-acquired. Since the criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia are not clearly defined in the provided information and assuming the trial aims to include patients with pneumonia regardless of the acquisition setting, the patient's condition appears to align with the intent of the trial criteria. Thus, based on the available information, the patient meets the inclusion criteria for age and presents with symptoms consistent with pneumonia, which could be considered under the community-acquired category based on the household exposure history.   \n",

The cohort is an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and is a partnership among two minority institutions (Jackson State University and Tougaloo College), one majority institution in Jackson, Mississippi (the University of Mississippi Medical Center), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).', 'detailed_description': 'BACKGROUND: Heart disease and stroke remain the first and third leading killers of all Americans, with a disproportionate share of the burden borne by African Americans. Cardiovascular and total mortality are known to be higher among African Americans than among white Americans, but reasons for these differences remain unknown. In addition, well-documented declines in CVD and coronary disease mortality in the past three decades have not been shared equally between blacks and whites. Age-adjusted death rates were identical in both groups in 1980, but by 1994 the rate among African Americans was 14% higher than in whites. The race difference in magnitude of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality is greater in women than men and higher in middle age, such that CHD deaths tend to occur in blacks about 5 years earlier than in whites. Excess cerebrovascular disease incidence and mortality in blacks are even greater than the differences noted in CHD. Cardiovascular mortality rates in Mississippi, which are approximately 25% higher than the United States average, are the highest in the United States for all race-sex groups. Age-adjusted CVD mortality for African American women in Mississippi was 75% higher than in white women in 1994. The mortality for African American men was 47% higher than in white men. Prevalence of hypertension is nearly 40% greater in African Americans than in whites and its sequelae are more frequent and severe. Evidence of target organ damage such as renal failure and left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in black than white hypertensives at comparable levels of blood pressure. Many risk factors are also more common in blacks, including diabetes, high serum lipoprotein levels [Lp(a)], and obesity (in women). Other risk factors, such as elevated total cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and heavy cigarette smoking, are more common in whites. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) initial examination, which began in the fall of 2000, included men and women ages 35 to 84, and took 3 years to complete. The coordinating center, located at Jackson State University, collects and analyzes data. The undergraduate training center at Tougaloo College offers coursework to students in public health and epidemiology, and provides practical experience in health research to prepare them for potential careers in these fields. The exam center at the University of Mississippi is responsible for recruiting participants and conducting examinations. JHS is uniquely positioned to answer key questions regarding the excess burden of CVD among African Americans and to address the critical shortage of minority investigators trained in epidemiology and prevention.

The immune system is composed of various cells (e.g., T and B cells and phagocytes) and other substances (complement system) that protect the body from infections and cancer. Abnormalities in the gene(s) responsible for the function of these components can lead to serious infections and other immune problems. Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, Janus Associated Kinase 3 (JAK3) deficiency, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and other immunodeficiencies may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo a medical and family history, physical examination, and additional procedures and tests that may include the following: 1. Blood tests for: routine laboratory studies (i.e. cell counts, enzyme levels, electrolytes, etc.); HIV testing; immune response to various substances; genetic testing; and establishment of cell lines to maintain a supply of cells for continued study 2. Urine and saliva tests for biochemical studies 3. Skin tests to assess response to antigens such as the viruses and bacteria responsible for tetanus, candida, tuberculosis, diphtheria, chicken pox, and other diseases. 4. Skin and lymph node biopsies for tissue and DNA studies 5. Chest X-ray, CT scans, or both to look for cancer or various infections. 6. Pulmonary function test to assess lung capacity and a breath test to test for H. pylori infection. 7. Dental, skin and eye examinations. 8. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or antibodies to prevent infections. 9. Apheresis for collecting white blood cells to study cell function. In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are then removed, and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body, either through the same needle or through a second needle placed in the other arm. 10. Bone marrow sampling to study the disease. A small amount of marrow from the hipbone is drawn (aspirated) through a needle. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia or light sedation. 11. Placental and umbilical cord blood studies, if cord blood is available, to study stem cells (cells that form blood cells). Information gained from this study may provide a better understanding of primary immunodeficiencies, leading to better diagnosis and treatment. In addition, study participants may receive medical and genetic counseling and may be found eligible for other NIH studies on these diseases.', 'detailed_description': 'The purpose of this protocol is to study patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders with the goal of contributing to both the clinical and molecular understanding of this heterogeneous group of inherited diseases. Clinical issues to be addressed will include disease manifestations and evolution, as well prevention and management of medical problems. Patients with diseases of known molecular basis (including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ADA deficiency, JAK3 deficiency and other syndromes) will be genotyped in order to investigate phenotype-genotype correlation. Patients with disease of unknown or incomplete genetic characterization will be studied with hopes of contributing to the identification of specific genes responsible for disease. Studies of fresh cells, cell lines and tissue samples will be performed to help characterize the patient s syndrome as well as to test the efficacy of genetic correction when available. The outcome we seek is to improve our knowledge of the molecular basis, clinical presentation and evolution of primary immunodeficiency diseases and to collaborate to maintain or improve the health status of our patients. No investigational clinical interventions are planned under this protocol. It is anticipated that additional protocols will be generated from preliminary data gathered in this umbrella study.'}   \n",

Recently, several research laboratories have reported that a protein, named CD40-ligand (CD154), is overexpressed by a subset of white blood cells, called lymphocytes, in patients with lupus. Expression of CD154 appears critical to the generation of antibodies that cause disease in lupus. Blocking CD154 interactions in the immune system has been shown to decrease disease activity in animal models of lupus.

It is of unknown etiology and was first described in Japan in 1967. The illness carries an acute mortality rate of approximately 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control defines Kawasaki Syndrome as a fever lasting five or more days for which no explanation can be found. Patients also must have at least four of the following symptoms: bilateral conjunctival infection; infected or fissured lips, pharynx, or a 'strawberry tongue'; erythema of the palms or soles, or edema of the hands or feet, or generalized or periungual desquamation; rash; and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery aneurysms occur in 15-20 percent of children with the illness. In the past, no treatment had been shown to be effective in preventing this complication. Investigators in Japan began to use IVGG to reduce the aneurysm formation. Preliminary results showing the usefulness of this therapy led to a multicenter trial in Japan in which 400 mg/kg/day of IVGG were given for five days to children also receiving aspirin for the condition. Results of the Japanese trial showed that within 29 days of the onset of the disease, coronary artery dilatation had developed in 42 percent of the aspirin-treated children and in 15 percent of the IVGG and aspirin-treated children. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Phase I was randomized, unblinded and stratified by age, sex, and center. Subjects were randomized to receive either 80 to 120 mg/kg/day of aspirin through day 14 of illness, subsequently reduced to 3 to 5 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose or to 400 mg/kg/day of intravenous gamma globulin for four consecutive days plus aspirin as above. Primary endpoint was formation of aneurysms as demonstrated by echocardiograms. Follow-up was for 7 weeks. Phase II of the trial began enrollment of 549 patients in May 1986 and ended enrollment in November 1989. Two hundred and seventy six children were randomized to receive 400 mg/kg of intravenous gamma globulin over four consecutive days. Two hundred and seventy-three received a single infusion of 2 g/kg of body weight over 10 hours. Both treatment groups received 100 mg/kg of aspirin per day through day 14 and then 3 to 5 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome variables were the presence or absence of coronary artery abnormalities evident at the two week and seven week follow-up examinations. Echocardiograms were obtained for 523 children at the two week visit and for 520 children at the seven week visit.'}   \n",

The prevalence of Graves' disease is quite high (2.7% in women), and there is solid evidence of genetic predisposition. Despite its clinical and scientific significance, Graves' disease is still mysterious in terms of its susceptibility genes or pathophysiological mechanisms. The immune repertoire, being the sum of T and B lymphocytes in a body at any given time, is both a snapshot and a historical record of a person's immune function. Thanks to the power of next-generation sequencing (NGS), massively parallel sequencing of the B cell and T cell receptors suddenly becomes plausible, and opens a door for many creative approaches to study immune related diseases. The ultimate goal of this project is to use both the NGS deep sequencing and immune repertoire experiment to perform Graves' disease sub-group genetic fine mapping, and to identify Graves' disease-specific T cell and B cell receptors. Furthermore, using the immune repertoire approach, investigators want to study the critical epitopes of thyroid auto-antigens, and to delineate the pathophysiological steps in various disease stages and in various sub-groups. Investigators expect to solve the immune repertoire of Graves' disease of different sub-group presentations and at various disease activity stages.', 'detailed_description': ''}   \n",

To test the accuracy of anatomical and functional non-invasive cardiac imaging in the diagnosis of IHD. To this purpose the \"anatomical\" information provided by CTA is obtained in every patient together with the \"functional\" information provided by stress radionuclide cardiac imaging (SPECT or PET), to assess myocardial perfusion, and/or by stress MRI or ECHO imaging to assess myocardial contraction. Non-invasive results are tested against invasive reference standards. The latter consists of invasive coronary angiography integrated by invasive measurement of fractional flow reserve (to assess the hemodynamic relevance of intermediate coronary stenoses). 2. To test the accuracy of integrated models, including clinical variables, risk factors and circulating biomarkers, to predict significant obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chronic angina-like symptoms. To correlate biohumoral profiles with the coronary anatomical-functional phenotype as obtained by non invasive imaging in the same patients. To reach these goals the clinical characterization of patients (collected before non-invasive imaging) and the laboratory characterization (that includes novel biomarkers of cardiovascular risk) are compared with patient characterization derived from non invasive \"anatomic-functional\" imaging and with invasive diagnosis of significantly obstructive coronary disease. 3. To develop an advanced clinical and imaging reporting tool in cardiology. An informatics platform is developed to synthetically and clearly present the integrated clinical and imaging diagnostic profile of individual patients. A multimodal imaging reporting tool is developed including tools for \"image fusion\" of different imaging modalities (CT, SPECT, PET, MRI). 4. To define the most cost-effective work-up for the diagnosis and characterization of IHD. To this purpose the costs and the procedural risks (including radiation exposure) of non-invasive and invasive diagnostic procedures are prospectively collected. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses is conducted alongside the EVINCI-study clinical trial.'}</td>\n",

Unfortunately, despite a number of medical advances, diagnostic procedure, or epidemiological studies, the treatment of these patients remain complex, and and at times frustrating. In fact, the COURAGE trial conducted in 50 centers across United States and Canada documented that drug treatment, coronary interventions or both were not effective solution in coronary artery diseases. A novel approach has recently been developed, based on the critical role of the potassium (K) content in red-blood-cell in myocardial oxygenation, since oxygen and K binding by hemoglobin (red-blood-cell) occurs simultaneously in blood passing through the lungs, whereas in the organs as the heart, the hemoglobin release both Oxygen and K ions. This apparently simple mechanisms occurs in human blood in all individuals but could be altered in subjects with acquired or hereditable defect in red-blood-cell K content. The purpose of this trial, thus, will be to evaluate the pharmacological effects of Amiloride on RBC K-uptake and transport and its impact on reversion of angina, electrocardiographic changes of myocardial ischemia and electrical regeneration of the heart in subjects with coronary artery diseases.', 'detailed_description': 'The Problem: Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) is a major health care problem across the entire word, and particularly in the United States, Japan and European Countries (1). In fact, these life-threatening disorders are a major cause of emergency medical care and hospitalization in the United States, and according the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) there were approximately 1,565,000 hospitalizations for primary or secondary diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 669,000 for unstable angina (UA) and 896,000 for myocardial infarction (MI). In the 2003, NCHS reported 4,497,000 visits to emergency departments for primary diagnosis of CVD, wherein the average age of a person having a first heart attack is calculated at 65.8 years for men and 70.4 years for women (2) Although the treatment of angina, chest pain secondary to coronary heart disease (stable chronic angina) and one of the most common and early symptom of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) can be tracked as far as 1880's, it still represents a medically unresolved problem. Indeed, treatment of angina in particular, as well as associated condition as ACS, UA, and MI, involves a large number of life-style recommendations, dietetic advice, drugs, coronary artery intervention, or coronary bypass surgery aimed to improve symptoms, quality of life of patients, and even primary or secondary prevention of the stable chronic angina. Unfortunately, despite a century of medical advances and epidemiological studies, the current approach to CVD and coronary heart disease remain complex, and at times frustrating. Among the proposals to treat stable chronic angina new aspects have been considered, including the single \"polypill\" agent (aspirin + statin + 3 blood pressure lowering agents in half dose, and folic acid), Simvastatin and intravascular ultrasound study, or intra-coronary angiogenesis therapy (3-5). However, most of them are unpractical, whereas it is difficult to determine whether these changes will translate to meaningful reductions in clinical events, or whether results in highly selected patient populations can be matched to the real-world of prevention and treatment of coronary artery syndromes. Further, a recent large clinical trial, COURAGE study (6), conducted in 50 hospital centers in the United States and Canada showed that optimal drug treatment and percutaneous coronary interventions for stable coronary heart disease, was not more effective than optimal medical therapy alone for preventing cardiovascular events, hospitalization or death, suggesting that drugs, surgical procedures or both were not a statistically effective solution for stable chronic angina. By inference, a therapeutic approach for mot severe coronary syndromes as UA, post- myocardial infarction angina, or aggravated angina episodes, seems to be a more distant goal. Physiological Basis for Innovation: For more than a century, the extremely rapid coupled tissue O2/CO2 gas exchange and ion H/K transport by Hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cell (RBC) has been well known for scientific community, the so-called Bohr/Haldane Effect (7). Since then, it has been noted and confirmed that RBC have a critical role to maintain normal vascular function, blood flow and tissue oxygenation and acid-base regulation. These functional roles of RBC include a nitric oxide (NO) transport, NO synthetasa, and regulation of platelet aggregation, vascular rheology, and endothelial function (8). Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that erythrocyte serves as a regulator of vascular tone and tissue perfusion, whereas the hemoglobin and RBC itself may be sensors for the oxygen tissue requirement (9). In this context, the evidence that erythrocytes are the major intravascular storage of nitrites (10), and that nitroglycerin effects on erythrocyte rheology and oxygen unloading in myocardial ischemia are mediated by S-Nitrosohemoglobin (11) implies that RBC K exchange should be preserved in subjects with CHD, especially if a hereditable defect in RBC K transport exists (12). Unfortunately, and despite such multiple integrated functions to maintain tissue oxygenation in health and diseases states, the role of RBC has never been considered in the therapeutic approach of stable chronic angina (13). However, our recent observation that reversal of an abnormal low RBC K content in hypertensive patients receiving low doses of pyrazinoylguanidine hydrochloride (amiloride HCl, 5 mg), and calcium gluconolactate was associated with a better control of BP, and regression of the ST-T alterations related to LVH or coronary heart disease (14), strongly support a novel mechanistic approaches to improve blood flow and myocardium oxygen transport in stable chronic angina. Informed consent will be obtained in each patient, and the Review board committee of the Docent Institute of Urology, University of Carabobo Medical School, Valencia, will approve the trial. This trial is a continuation of the Protocol ID UIC-3 2007 (Novel Treatment for Coronary Artery Disease, NCT 01228214) and will be also registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov METHODS (I) Clinical Methods At the inclusion period and in each clinical visit all subjects had measurements of BP, HR, body weight/height and measurement of body resistance and reactance for Body Composition Analysis of Total Body water and extra-cellular spaces, Fat-Free-Mass, Fat Mass.

This study uses an internet based survey to ask individuals how they obtained medical care in the midst of a heart attack. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals stricken with a heart attack prevents them from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based medical care in a timely manner to reduce the long term health consequences of a heart attack. By using a self-tailoring survey instrument the study attempts to take into consideration the complex social processes by which the individual and their family make decisions to seek medical care for symptoms of a heart attack. The study is designed to obtain a national sample of ACS care-seeking behavior in the United States.', 'detailed_description': 'The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of care-seeking behavior surrounding acute coronary syndromes [ACS] through the application and testing of an integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] and the utilization of a world wide web [WWW] based ISCM survey instrument. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals stricken with ACS [acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina or sudden cardiac death] prevents many patients from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based thrombolytic and/or mechanical reperfusion therapy to reduce the morbid and mortal consequences of acute cardiovascular disease [CVD]. Results from prior studies of ACS care-seeking delay generally rely on measures of time duration from acute symptom onset [ASO] to hospital emergency department [ED] arrival and measures of social demographic and clinical variables, extracted from emergency medical system [EMS] logs and/or ED charts. By relying on such limited data sources, these studies have failed to take into consideration the complexity of the social and behavioral processes by which individuals make decisions to seek medical care for symptoms of ACS. By applying and testing an integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] to ACS care-seeking, it will be possible to delineate decision points and situations and circumstances that are critical to producing patterns of care-seeking that are efficient and expeditious or are protracted and delayed. The care-seeking process in the ISCM is viewed in terms of five analytic care-seeking phases from warning or premonitory symptoms to ED arrival. By noting the presence or absence of three central phases, it is possible to distinguish patterns of care-seeking and to record the duration of each care-seeking phase and total duration of each care-seeking path to the ED. The ISCM assumes that coping behaviors emerge over time and initially care-seeking behaviors are guided by demographic and structural factors. As the self-regulatory and coping processes emerge over the course of the ACS episode, the influence of these factors diminishes and emergent ACS evaluations, advice from others and health care providers, emerging symptoms and emotions, come to dominate the care-seeking process and directly determine the duration of ACS care-seeking. The study will test and explore the following hypotheses: 1. Commonly used demographic variables, such as, age, sex, education and race will prove to be only one component, along with social situational and circumstantial, cognitive and emotional variables, that significantly influence the course and duration of ACS care-seeking. 2. The ISCM will show that decision process variables associated with the care-seeking phases, the Self, Lay and Health Care Provider Phases, as shown in the Figure, are important predictors of time from symptoms onset to ED arrival and in the prediction of the length of time spent in each care-seeking phase. 3. The ISCM will show differences in the total duration of the 5 most frequently occurring care-seeking paths to the ED and will explain most of the differences by the variables in Hypotheses 1 and 2. 4. Conditional models of subjects who use key care-seeking phases, namely the Self, Lay and Health Care Provider Phases, will identify unique predictors of time in each phase. 5. Significant interaction effects [model coefficient differences] will be found for important risk variables and socially important gender, age and racial groups. For example, African-Americans will show differences in model coefficients from Non-African-Americans. The proposed study utilizes a twice tested pilot ISCM survey instrument placed on two secure dedicated web servers to collect patient care-seeking data. The target sample size for this study is 2,314 patients who have experienced an ACS episode. Subjects will be recruited using: 1] extensive marketing of the study URL on websites of interest to cardiac patients and oriented toward cardiac health and ACS risks, such as, diabetes or hypertension; 2] placement of study information on discussion boards and chat rooms with a cardiac health focus; 3] emailing of a study flyer PDF for posting in public libraries, senior citizen centers, African-American churches, county and municipal health clinics, and HMO web sites; 4] application of a viral marketing strategy; and 5] use of selected print media, for example, AARP publications. Marketing of the study site URL will emphasize the recruitment of women, the elderly and minorities. In the data collection phase of the study, the proportions of myocardial infarction and angina pectoris subjects falling into each cell of the cross classification of age, sex and race will be derived from NHANES 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 studies. These estimates of the population proportions in these cells will be used to determine quotas for each of the cells in an attempt to ensure all risk groups are adequately represented. We will over sample African-Americans. Statistical models will be used to estimate the effects of variables that characterize the decision process on the time delay until ED arrival. Time required to move from one phase of the decision process to the next will also be modeled, as will the different paths chosen by the subjects. Models will also include patient characteristics and other circumstantial and situational variables in the decision process.'}</td>\n",

(Most clinicians and patients believe that insomnia becomes a clinical problem requiring therapy when excessive daytime sleepiness impairs cognition and mood, interfering with a patient's performance of functions that require alertness. Chronic sleep deprivation often leads to adverse personal, medical and psychiatric complications, underscoring the common request of patients for treatment by their physician. With an increasing focus on the problem of sleep deprivation in children of all ages, our appreciation of the scope of the problem is expanding. It is estimated that up to 40 % of infants experience difficulty in settling and frequent nighttime wakings with sleep disturbances including bedtime resistance, delayed onset of sleep, and disruptive night wakings occurring in 25 to 50 % of preschoolers. In school-aged children, parents reported an incidence of bedtime resistance in 15 % of their children. Very limited data exist describing the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem in pediatrics. Colle and colleagues reported the zolpidem clearance to be 3 times greater in children (n=6) compared to young adults (n=104) though Cmax and AUC values were similar despite a higher zolpidem dose (mg/Kg) in the children. Unfortunately these data raise more questions than they answer regarding zolpidem disposition relative to age and highlight the need to comprehensively determine zolpidem disposition characteristics across a broad age range of pediatric subjects. In summary, although researchers have been hesitant to include children in drug studies, the data indicate that pediatric sleep disturbance have a negative health impact on children and warrant pharmacologic intervention. Studies to identify the appropriate drug and dosage for children of all ages are essential in addressing this health problem that impacts the child and his/her family.'}</td>\n",

Adenotonsillectomy (AT), the second most common surgical procedure in children, is now performed more often for suspected SDB than for any other indication. However, recent studies among an increasingly obese population now show something alarming: many if not most children still have SDB after AT, and many still suffer from residual neurobehavioral morbidity. Furthermore, the investigators' ongoing, 12-year, NIH-funded research has shown that standard preoperative polysomnographic measures of SDB do not consistently predict post-AT improvement in behavior and cognition. This may arise in part because many children after AT still have SDB, and because linear relationships between standard SDB measures and neurobehavioral morbidity may not exist. Even at subtle levels, SDB may promote significant neurobehavioral morbidity. Some have suggested that polysomnography may be more important after AT than before AT. However, in practice few children receive polysomnography before AT, and even fewer after AT, when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) could still provide definitive relief from SDB. Preliminary data from our group suggest that CPAP after AT is well-tolerated by most children and may provide significant benefit. However, virtually no published evidence exists to address critical clinical questions: which children benefit most from CPAP after AT; what role can clinical symptoms or polysomnography play in that determination; and what neurobehavioral gains are achieved by CPAP after AT? The investigators therefore will undertake a highly practical, clinical study with two main goals: (1) to assess the extent that behavior, cognition, and sleepiness in children can improve with CPAP after AT, and (2) to identify which patients stand to gain most from post-operative assessment and treatment. This research will use reversible SDB-related neurobehavioral morbidity as the criteria by which to judge the utility of clinical symptoms and polysomnography in identification of candidates for CPAP after AT.'}</td>\n",

The majority of surgeries are performed for obstructed breathing rather than for infection or other indications. The role of adenotonsillectomy (AT) in improving the 7-month neurocognitive, behavioral and health outcomes of children with frank obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was recently addressed in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). The results of this rigorous, multicenter, randomized controlled trial provided critically important data indicating that adenotonsillectomy compared to watchful waiting resulted in improved behavior, quality of life, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms and polysomnographic parameters. However, the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial addressed the role of surgery in the minority of operative candidates who have frank obstructive sleep apnea, only one form of sleep disordered breathing on a spectrum that includes a more common phenotype, primary snoring (also termed mild sleep disordered breathing (MSDB)). Mild sleep disordered breathing is characterized by snoring without frank obstruction or gas exchange abnormalities, and has a population prevalence of about 10% in children. Since most surgeries for obstructed breathing are performed for mild sleep disordered breathing rather than obstructive sleep apnea, the next logical question is whether surgery is also effective in improving symptoms and health outcomes in this large group of children. The Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial for Snoring (PATS) intends to take advantage of a successful collaboration of leaders in sleep medicine, otolaryngology and clinical trials to efficiently leverage experiences from CHAT trial to evaluate the role of adenotonsillectomy in children with mild sleep disordered breathing while also aiming to resolve uncertainties regarding management approaches for pediatric mild sleep disordered breathing by addressing several critical issues: 1. Assess outcomes important to children and their families, particularly patient-reported outcomes such as behavior, quality of life, and sleep disturbances. 2. Examine differences in treatment responses among children who are at increased risk for mild sleep disordered breathing, such as pre-school children, minorities, and children with asthma or obesity. 3. Evaluate health care utilization of children with mild sleep disordered breathing. 4. Assess moderating influences such as second hand smoke, insufficient sleep, socioeconomic status and family functioning 5. Examine longer term (12 month) outcomes that were not feasible in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). These aims have substantial public health significance given the high morbidity of sleep disordered breathing in children.'}</td>\n",

       "3800                The patient's symptoms, including nighttime snoring, pauses in breathing, restlessness, and nighttime awakenings, along with declining grades, lack of attention, and excessive sleepiness during class, suggest a strong possibility of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which aligns with the trial's target population. The trial focuses on the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) after adenotonsillectomy in children, aiming to improve behavior, cognition, and sleepiness. Given the patient's age (10 years old) falls within the trial's inclusion criteria (5-12 years old), there is a foundational alignment.   \n",

The trial aims to investigate reaction time among these children, which could be relevant given the patient's declining grades and lack of attention, possibly related to sleep disturbances.   \n",
       "3816  The patient's symptoms of nighttime snoring, pauses in breathing, restlessness, and nighttime awakenings, along with associated symptoms like declining grades and excessive sleepiness, suggest a potential alignment with the trial's target population of children with mild sleep-disordered breathing (MSDB). However, the lack of critical information, such as obstructive apnea index (OAI) and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) values, parental report of habitual snoring frequency, tonsillar hypertrophy assessment, and otolaryngologist evaluation, makes it challenging to determine the patient's eligibility for the trial with certainty.   \n",

However, critical information is missing to definitively determine eligibility for the trial. The absence of a previous positive exercise tolerance test result, the specific diagnosis of chronic stable angina, an assessment of the disease's suitability for coronary intervention, and the exact BMI value are all necessary to confirm whether the patient meets all inclusion criteria. Without this information, it's impossible to make a definitive determination of the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial.   \n",

While the patient's age (58 years), gender (female), and symptoms (episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain) are documented, there is no information provided about the exercise stress test results, which are crucial for determining the risk of IHD. Additionally, the patient's medical history includes hypertension and obesity, which are risk factors for IHD, but without specific details on the severity and pattern of symptoms or quantitative information, it's challenging to assess the patient's risk accurately. Therefore, due to the lack of critical information, particularly the exercise stress test results and detailed symptom severity, the patient's eligibility for the trial cannot be determined.   \n",

While the patient is within the age range (58 years old) and has hypertension, which aligns with some of the inclusion criteria, several key pieces of information are missing. The absence of specific blood pressure readings, serum potassium levels, detailed EKG findings, and confirmation of compliance and informed consent make it impossible to confirm whether all inclusion criteria are met. Additionally, the patient's symptoms suggest angina, but the specific classification according to the Canada Cardiovascular Society is not provided. Given the missing information, it's not possible to definitively include or exclude the patient from the trial based on the provided data.   \n",

       "3786  The patient summary lacks critical information necessary to determine eligibility for the clinical trial. While the patient's age (10 years old) meets the first inclusion criterion, and being male simplifies the third criterion regarding pregnancy and contraception, the core issue of insomnia diagnosis and its impact cannot be fully assessed. The patient's symptoms (nighttime snoring, pauses in breathing, restlessness, and nighttime awakenings) and associated issues (declining grades, lack of attention, excessive sleepiness) suggest sleep disturbances but do not provide enough detail to confirm the insomnia diagnosis as defined by the trial criteria. Furthermore, there is no information on whether the sleep disturbance is attributable to the direct physiologic effect of a drug of abuse or misuse of a prescribed medication, or if it occurs exclusively in the context of other sleep disorders. The absence of detailed medical history, diagnostic test results, and specific information about the sleep disturbance's severity and impact on daily functioning makes it impossible to confirm whether all inclusion criteria are met. Therefore, the eligibility of the patient for the clinical trial remains undetermined due to missing critical information.   \n",

Specifically, there are no data on the patient's OAI and AHI values, which are crucial for diagnosing mild sleep-disordered breathing (MSDB). Additionally, the summary does not include a parental report of habitual snoring frequency, an assessment of tonsillar hypertrophy, or an evaluation by an otolaryngologist regarding surgical candidacy for adenotonsillectomy. Without this information, it is impossible to confirm whether the patient meets all the inclusion criteria for the trial. The presence of nighttime snoring, pauses in breathing, restlessness, and nighttime awakenings, along with associated symptoms like declining grades and excessive sleepiness, suggests potential relevance to the trial's focus but does not provide sufficient evidence to make a definitive determination.   \n",

exercise tolerance test - to ensure that repeating it yields a result - Disease not suitable for coronary intervention (Coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty) - so that best routine care is

used as a new treatment for angina when compared with placebo in overweight subjects who do not have overt diabetes. The drug will be given for 3 months and the subjects will be have their angina tested, by way of exercise testing, angina quality of life questionnaire and 24-hour ECG monitoring before and after using the drug.', 'detailed_description': 'Chronic stable angina is a common manifestation of ischaemic heart disease. Current mechanical therapies (percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting) and pharmacological therapies (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, betablockers and potassium channel activators) main actions are to treat the end product of ischaemic heart disease on chronic stable angina, i.e. the flow limiting stenosis. We postulate that by treating insulin resistance, an upstream factor in the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart disease, we will improve angina by in turn improving endothelial function. We will attempt to demonstrate this by way of full bruce protocol exercise tolerance test, Seattle Angina Questionnaire and 24 hour ST segment analysis before and after treatment with the insulin sensitiser rosiglitazone for three months.'}   \n",

To test the accuracy of anatomical and functional non-invasive cardiac imaging in the diagnosis of IHD. To this purpose the \"anatomical\" information provided by CTA is obtained in every patient together with the \"functional\" information provided by stress radionuclide cardiac imaging (SPECT or PET), to assess myocardial perfusion, and/or by stress MRI or ECHO imaging to assess myocardial contraction. Non-invasive results are tested against invasive reference standards. The latter consists of invasive coronary angiography integrated by invasive measurement of fractional flow reserve (to assess the hemodynamic relevance of intermediate coronary stenoses). 2. To test the accuracy of integrated models, including clinical variables, risk factors and circulating biomarkers, to predict significant obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chronic angina-like symptoms. To correlate biohumoral profiles with the coronary anatomical-functional phenotype as obtained by non invasive imaging in the same patients. To reach these goals the clinical characterization of patients (collected before non-invasive imaging) and the laboratory characterization (that includes novel biomarkers of cardiovascular risk) are compared with patient characterization derived from non invasive \"anatomic-functional\" imaging and with invasive diagnosis of significantly obstructive coronary disease. 3. To develop an advanced clinical and imaging reporting tool in cardiology. An informatics platform is developed to synthetically and clearly present the integrated clinical and imaging diagnostic profile of individual patients. A multimodal imaging reporting tool is developed including tools for \"image fusion\" of different imaging modalities (CT, SPECT, PET, MRI). 4. To define the most cost-effective work-up for the diagnosis and characterization of IHD. To this purpose the costs and the procedural risks (including radiation exposure) of non-invasive and invasive diagnostic procedures are prospectively collected. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses is conducted alongside the EVINCI-study clinical trial.'}   \n",

Unfortunately, despite a number of medical advances, diagnostic procedure, or epidemiological studies, the treatment of these patients remain complex, and and at times frustrating. In fact, the COURAGE trial conducted in 50 centers across United States and Canada documented that drug treatment, coronary interventions or both were not effective solution in coronary artery diseases. A novel approach has recently been developed, based on the critical role of the potassium (K) content in red-blood-cell in myocardial oxygenation, since oxygen and K binding by hemoglobin (red-blood-cell) occurs simultaneously in blood passing through the lungs, whereas in the organs as the heart, the hemoglobin release both Oxygen and K ions. This apparently simple mechanisms occurs in human blood in all individuals but could be altered in subjects with acquired or hereditable defect in red-blood-cell K content. The purpose of this trial, thus, will be to evaluate the pharmacological effects of Amiloride on RBC K-uptake and transport and its impact on reversion of angina, electrocardiographic changes of myocardial ischemia and electrical regeneration of the heart in subjects with coronary artery diseases.', 'detailed_description': 'The Problem: Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) is a major health care problem across the entire word, and particularly in the United States, Japan and European Countries (1). In fact, these life-threatening disorders are a major cause of emergency medical care and hospitalization in the United States, and according the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) there were approximately 1,565,000 hospitalizations for primary or secondary diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 669,000 for unstable angina (UA) and 896,000 for myocardial infarction (MI). In the 2003, NCHS reported 4,497,000 visits to emergency departments for primary diagnosis of CVD, wherein the average age of a person having a first heart attack is calculated at 65.8 years for men and 70.4 years for women (2) Although the treatment of angina, chest pain secondary to coronary heart disease (stable chronic angina) and one of the most common and early symptom of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) can be tracked as far as 1880's, it still represents a medically unresolved problem. Indeed, treatment of angina in particular, as well as associated condition as ACS, UA, and MI, involves a large number of life-style recommendations, dietetic advice, drugs, coronary artery intervention, or coronary bypass surgery aimed to improve symptoms, quality of life of patients, and even primary or secondary prevention of the stable chronic angina. Unfortunately, despite a century of medical advances and epidemiological studies, the current approach to CVD and coronary heart disease remain complex, and at times frustrating. Among the proposals to treat stable chronic angina new aspects have been considered, including the single \"polypill\" agent (aspirin + statin + 3 blood pressure lowering agents in half dose, and folic acid), Simvastatin and intravascular ultrasound study, or intra-coronary angiogenesis therapy (3-5). However, most of them are unpractical, whereas it is difficult to determine whether these changes will translate to meaningful reductions in clinical events, or whether results in highly selected patient populations can be matched to the real-world of prevention and treatment of coronary artery syndromes. Further, a recent large clinical trial, COURAGE study (6), conducted in 50 hospital centers in the United States and Canada showed that optimal drug treatment and percutaneous coronary interventions for stable coronary heart disease, was not more effective than optimal medical therapy alone for preventing cardiovascular events, hospitalization or death, suggesting that drugs, surgical procedures or both were not a statistically effective solution for stable chronic angina. By inference, a therapeutic approach for mot severe coronary syndromes as UA, post- myocardial infarction angina, or aggravated angina episodes, seems to be a more distant goal. Physiological Basis for Innovation: For more than a century, the extremely rapid coupled tissue O2/CO2 gas exchange and ion H/K transport by Hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cell (RBC) has been well known for scientific community, the so-called Bohr/Haldane Effect (7). Since then, it has been noted and confirmed that RBC have a critical role to maintain normal vascular function, blood flow and tissue oxygenation and acid-base regulation. These functional roles of RBC include a nitric oxide (NO) transport, NO synthetasa, and regulation of platelet aggregation, vascular rheology, and endothelial function (8). Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that erythrocyte serves as a regulator of vascular tone and tissue perfusion, whereas the hemoglobin and RBC itself may be sensors for the oxygen tissue requirement (9). In this context, the evidence that erythrocytes are the major intravascular storage of nitrites (10), and that nitroglycerin effects on erythrocyte rheology and oxygen unloading in myocardial ischemia are mediated by S-Nitrosohemoglobin (11) implies that RBC K exchange should be preserved in subjects with CHD, especially if a hereditable defect in RBC K transport exists (12). Unfortunately, and despite such multiple integrated functions to maintain tissue oxygenation in health and diseases states, the role of RBC has never been considered in the therapeutic approach of stable chronic angina (13). However, our recent observation that reversal of an abnormal low RBC K content in hypertensive patients receiving low doses of pyrazinoylguanidine hydrochloride (amiloride HCl, 5 mg), and calcium gluconolactate was associated with a better control of BP, and regression of the ST-T alterations related to LVH or coronary heart disease (14), strongly support a novel mechanistic approaches to improve blood flow and myocardium oxygen transport in stable chronic angina. Informed consent will be obtained in each patient, and the Review board committee of the Docent Institute of Urology, University of Carabobo Medical School, Valencia, will approve the trial. This trial is a continuation of the Protocol ID UIC-3 2007 (Novel Treatment for Coronary Artery Disease, NCT 01228214) and will be also registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov METHODS (I) Clinical Methods At the inclusion period and in each clinical visit all subjects had measurements of BP, HR, body weight/height and measurement of body resistance and reactance for Body Composition Analysis of Total Body water and extra-cellular spaces, Fat-Free-Mass, Fat Mass. Number of anginal episodes, and functional anginal class (CCS) will be recorded in each case. (II) Laboratory Methods All patients will have routine measurement of Ion Transport Studies, which includes a 12-hour night (7 pm- 7 am) urine collection, followed by fasting state for measurement of plasma (Na, K, Cl, Mg++, Ionized calcium), RBC (Na, K, H2O content), and urine (Na, K, Cl, Mg++, calcium) electrolytes, along with plasma and urine osmolality, at entry, 4-week, and at 3, 8 and 12-months period. (III) Cardiovascular Studies All subjects All subjects had resting 12-lead ECG at entry, and non-invasive hemodynamic and PWA (DynaPulse200M, San Diego, CA) for Aortic Stiffness (Augmentation index, and Travel-Time-Reflected-Wave), Systemic and Brachial Artery Resistance and Compliances, obtained at entry and during clinical visits, including possible emergency attention. EchoC, or Doppler studies will be evaluated at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month periods.'}   \n",

This study uses an internet based survey to ask individuals how they obtained medical care in the midst of a heart attack. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals stricken with a heart attack prevents them from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based medical care in a timely manner to reduce the long term health consequences of a heart attack. By using a self-tailoring survey instrument the study attempts to take into consideration the complex social processes by which the individual and their family make decisions to seek medical care for symptoms of a heart attack. The study is designed to obtain a national sample of ACS care-seeking behavior in the United States.', 'detailed_description': 'The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of care-seeking behavior surrounding acute coronary syndromes [ACS] through the application and testing of an integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] and the utilization of a world wide web [WWW] based ISCM survey instrument. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals stricken with ACS [acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina or sudden cardiac death] prevents many patients from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based thrombolytic and/or mechanical reperfusion therapy to reduce the morbid and mortal consequences of acute cardiovascular disease [CVD]. Results from prior studies of ACS care-seeking delay generally rely on measures of time duration from acute symptom onset [ASO] to hospital emergency department [ED] arrival and measures of social demographic and clinical variables, extracted from emergency medical system [EMS] logs and/or ED charts. By relying on such limited data sources, these studies have failed to take into consideration the complexity of the social and behavioral processes by which individuals make decisions to seek medical care for symptoms of ACS. By applying and testing an integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] to ACS care-seeking, it will be possible to delineate decision points and situations and circumstances that are critical to producing patterns of care-seeking that are efficient and expeditious or are protracted and delayed. The care-seeking process in the ISCM is viewed in terms of five analytic care-seeking phases from warning or premonitory symptoms to ED arrival. By noting the presence or absence of three central phases, it is possible to distinguish patterns of care-seeking and to record the duration of each care-seeking phase and total duration of each care-seeking path to the ED. The ISCM assumes that coping behaviors emerge over time and initially care-seeking behaviors are guided by demographic and structural factors. As the self-regulatory and coping processes emerge over the course of the ACS episode, the influence of these factors diminishes and emergent ACS evaluations, advice from others and health care providers, emerging symptoms and emotions, come to dominate the care-seeking process and directly determine the duration of ACS care-seeking. The study will test and explore the following hypotheses: 1. Commonly used demographic variables, such as, age, sex, education and race will prove to be only one component, along with social situational and circumstantial, cognitive and emotional variables, that significantly influence the course and duration of ACS care-seeking. 2. The ISCM will show that decision process variables associated with the care-seeking phases, the Self, Lay and Health Care Provider Phases, as shown in the Figure, are important predictors of time from symptoms onset to ED arrival and in the prediction of the length of time spent in each care-seeking phase. 3. The ISCM will show differences in the total duration of the 5 most frequently occurring care-seeking paths to the ED and will explain most of the differences by the variables in Hypotheses 1 and 2. 4. Conditional models of subjects who use key care-seeking phases, namely the Self, Lay and Health Care Provider Phases, will identify unique predictors of time in each phase. 5. Significant interaction effects [model coefficient differences] will be found for important risk variables and socially important gender, age and racial groups. For example, African-Americans will show differences in model coefficients from Non-African-Americans. The proposed study utilizes a twice tested pilot ISCM survey instrument placed on two secure dedicated web servers to collect patient care-seeking data. The target sample size for this study is 2,314 patients who have experienced an ACS episode. Subjects will be recruited using: 1] extensive marketing of the study URL on websites of interest to cardiac patients and oriented toward cardiac health and ACS risks, such as, diabetes or hypertension; 2] placement of study information on discussion boards and chat rooms with a cardiac health focus; 3] emailing of a study flyer PDF for posting in public libraries, senior citizen centers, African-American churches, county and municipal health clinics, and HMO web sites; 4] application of a viral marketing strategy; and 5] use of selected print media, for example, AARP publications. Marketing of the study site URL will emphasize the recruitment of women, the elderly and minorities. In the data collection phase of the study, the proportions of myocardial infarction and angina pectoris subjects falling into each cell of the cross classification of age, sex and race will be derived from NHANES 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 studies. These estimates of the population proportions in these cells will be used to determine quotas for each of the cells in an attempt to ensure all risk groups are adequately represented. We will over sample African-Americans. Statistical models will be used to estimate the effects of variables that characterize the decision process on the time delay until ED arrival. Time required to move from one phase of the decision process to the next will also be modeled, as will the different paths chosen by the subjects. Models will also include patient characteristics and other circumstantial and situational variables in the decision process.'}   \n",

(Most clinicians and patients believe that insomnia becomes a clinical problem requiring therapy when excessive daytime sleepiness impairs cognition and mood, interfering with a patient's performance of functions that require alertness. Chronic sleep deprivation often leads to adverse personal, medical and psychiatric complications, underscoring the common request of patients for treatment by their physician. With an increasing focus on the problem of sleep deprivation in children of all ages, our appreciation of the scope of the problem is expanding. It is estimated that up to 40 % of infants experience difficulty in settling and frequent nighttime wakings with sleep disturbances including bedtime resistance, delayed onset of sleep, and disruptive night wakings occurring in 25 to 50 % of preschoolers. In school-aged children, parents reported an incidence of bedtime resistance in 15 % of their children. Very limited data exist describing the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem in pediatrics. Colle and colleagues reported the zolpidem clearance to be 3 times greater in children (n=6) compared to young adults (n=104) though Cmax and AUC values were similar despite a higher zolpidem dose (mg/Kg) in the children. Unfortunately these data raise more questions than they answer regarding zolpidem disposition relative to age and highlight the need to comprehensively determine zolpidem disposition characteristics across a broad age range of pediatric subjects. In summary, although researchers have been hesitant to include children in drug studies, the data indicate that pediatric sleep disturbance have a negative health impact on children and warrant pharmacologic intervention. Studies to identify the appropriate drug and dosage for children of all ages are essential in addressing this health problem that impacts the child and his/her family.'}   \n",

However, recent studies indicate that many if not most children still have SDB after AT, and many still have learning or behavioral problems associated with SDB. The goals of this study are: (1) to assess the extent that behavior, cognition, and sleepiness in children can improve with Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment after AT, and (2) to identify which patients stand to gain most from post-operative assessment and treatment.', 'detailed_description': 'Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) affects at least 2-3% of children and may have substantial adverse impact on behavior and cognition. Adenotonsillectomy (AT), the second most common surgical procedure in children, is now performed more often for suspected SDB than for any other indication. However, recent studies among an increasingly obese population now show something alarming: many if not most children still have SDB after AT, and many still suffer from residual neurobehavioral morbidity. Furthermore, the investigators' ongoing, 12-year, NIH-funded research has shown that standard preoperative polysomnographic measures of SDB do not consistently predict post-AT improvement in behavior and cognition. This may arise in part because many children after AT still have SDB, and because linear relationships between standard SDB measures and neurobehavioral morbidity may not exist. Even at subtle levels, SDB may promote significant neurobehavioral morbidity. Some have suggested that polysomnography may be more important after AT than before AT. However, in practice few children receive polysomnography before AT, and even fewer after AT, when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) could still provide definitive relief from SDB. Preliminary data from our group suggest that CPAP after AT is well-tolerated by most children and may provide significant benefit. However, virtually no published evidence exists to address critical clinical questions: which children benefit most from CPAP after AT; what role can clinical symptoms or polysomnography play in that determination; and what neurobehavioral gains are achieved by CPAP after AT? The investigators therefore will undertake a highly practical, clinical study with two main goals: (1) to assess the extent that behavior, cognition, and sleepiness in children can improve with CPAP after AT, and (2) to identify which patients stand to gain most from post-operative assessment and treatment. This research will use reversible SDB-related neurobehavioral morbidity as the criteria by which to judge the utility of clinical symptoms and polysomnography in identification of candidates for CPAP after AT.'}   \n",

Half of participants will receive eAT, while the other half will be observed with watchful waiting and supportive care.', 'detailed_description': 'Adenotonsillectomies are performed more than 500,000 times per year in the United States, and is the most common surgery performed under general anesthesia in children. The majority of surgeries are performed for obstructed breathing rather than for infection or other indications. The role of adenotonsillectomy (AT) in improving the 7-month neurocognitive, behavioral and health outcomes of children with frank obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was recently addressed in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). The results of this rigorous, multicenter, randomized controlled trial provided critically important data indicating that adenotonsillectomy compared to watchful waiting resulted in improved behavior, quality of life, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms and polysomnographic parameters. However, the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial addressed the role of surgery in the minority of operative candidates who have frank obstructive sleep apnea, only one form of sleep disordered breathing on a spectrum that includes a more common phenotype, primary snoring (also termed mild sleep disordered breathing (MSDB)). Mild sleep disordered breathing is characterized by snoring without frank obstruction or gas exchange abnormalities, and has a population prevalence of about 10% in children. Since most surgeries for obstructed breathing are performed for mild sleep disordered breathing rather than obstructive sleep apnea, the next logical question is whether surgery is also effective in improving symptoms and health outcomes in this large group of children. The Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial for Snoring (PATS) intends to take advantage of a successful collaboration of leaders in sleep medicine, otolaryngology and clinical trials to efficiently leverage experiences from CHAT trial to evaluate the role of adenotonsillectomy in children with mild sleep disordered breathing while also aiming to resolve uncertainties regarding management approaches for pediatric mild sleep disordered breathing by addressing several critical issues: 1. Assess outcomes important to children and their families, particularly patient-reported outcomes such as behavior, quality of life, and sleep disturbances. 2. Examine differences in treatment responses among children who are at increased risk for mild sleep disordered breathing, such as pre-school children, minorities, and children with asthma or obesity. 3. Evaluate health care utilization of children with mild sleep disordered breathing. 4. Assess moderating influences such as second hand smoke, insufficient sleep, socioeconomic status and family functioning 5. Examine longer term (12 month) outcomes that were not feasible in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). These aims have substantial public health significance given the high morbidity of sleep disordered breathing in children.'}   \n",

This study was created to determine whether there is a relationship between sex and body size and the incidence of heart disease in African American men and women. Researchers will attempt to associate obesity with the presence of heart disease risk factors. Risk factors that will be studied include; total body fat, body fat distribution, fat content of the blood (triglyceride concentration, low density lipoproteins [LDL], and high density lipoproteins [HDL]), how fast fat is removed from the blood, and how well insulin works in the body. Scientific studies have shown that obesity and increased levels of fat content in the blood are important risk factors for heart disease in Caucasian women. However, similar studies in African American women have failed to show the same correlation. In fact, it appears that African American women in all three body weight groupings, nonobese, overweight, and obese experience high death rates due to heart disease. In addition, prior research has shown that obese African American men tend to have elevated levels of fat in the blood while African American women have normal blood fat levels. Therefore, if high levels of triglycerides (fat found in the blood) are not seen in non-diabetic obese African American women, it cannot be considered a risk factor in this population. This suggests that studies conducted on Caucasian women may not provide insight into heart disease risk factors in African American women. The study will take 120 healthy nondiabetic African American men and women (ages 18-50) grouped by sex (60 men and 60 women) and body mass index 3 subgroups; nonobese, overweight and obese). Diabetes undeniably increases the risk of heart disease. Therefore patients suffering from diabetes will not be included in the study. Candidates for the study will undergo a series of tests and examinations over 5 outpatient visits. Subjects will have body fat analyses, resting energy expenditure measurements, an EKG (electrocardiogram), and specific blood tests. Researchers believe this study will provide significant insight into the causes of obesity and heart disease in African Americans.', 'detailed_description': 'This study is designed to investigate in blacks the relationship of risk for diabetes and heart disease from obesity plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations and the triglyceride related risk factors of small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and central obesity. The Framingham Study demonstrated that obesity and elevated glucose and triglyceride levels are important risk factors for coronary artery disease in white women. However, studies that have had significant participation of black women such as the Charleston Heart Study, failed to show a relationship of obesity or triglyceride to coronary artery disease mortality in black women. In fact, black women independent of body weight or triglyceride levels experience high mortality from coronary artery disease. Our earlier research has demonstrated that obese black men have elevated triglyceride levels but obese black women have normal triglyceride levels. Consequently if elevated triglyceride levels do not occur in obese nondiabetic black women, then elevated triglyceride levels may not represent a major cardiovascular risk for black women. The study, Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk in Blacks, is designed to determine the role of obesity, glucose and triglyceride on risk for heart disease in blacks. For this study of blacks, we will study 2 groups, African Americans and Black Africans living in the United States. African Americans must self-identify as African American, be born in the United States and have parents who self-identify as African American and were born in the United States. The second group will be blacks living in the United States but were born in Africa and whose parents were born in Africa. We will recruit 1132 healthy, non-diabetic individuals (546 men, 586 women), age range 18-65, and body mass index (3 subgroups: nonobese, overweight and obese). We need to recruit more women than men because triglyceride and glucose levels are lower in women than men. Therefore a larger number of women are needed to see an effect. In 3 outpatient visits to the Clinical Center, participants will have body fat analyses, an electrocardiogram, an oral glucose tolerance test, questionnaires about sleep and stress and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. This study has the potential to provide significant insight and lead to the development of programs that help decrease diabetes and cardiovascular risk in blacks.'}</td>\n",

Most children who visit a cardiology specialist with complaints of chest or other somatic pain have no known medical diagnosis to explain their symptoms. These children and their families often leave with no explanation for the child's distress. This early study will ask parents and children specific questions related to the stress in their lives, their emotional well-being and the children's physical functioning. The investigators want children who experience chest and other somatic pain, and those who do not, to be in their study so that they can look at both groups. The investigators hope to use these answers to better inform cardiologists who often work with children with non-cardiac pain and, in turn, help them to better serve their patients. Ultimately, the investigators hope that the answers they get will provide answers to these families. They also hope to use the results of this study to put together a short screener for the cardiologist to give to pediatric patients with complaints of chest or other somatic pain to help the cardiologists better understand their patients' symptoms.', 'detailed_description': 'The current investigation will address some similar factors considered in prior research, but will considerably extend our understanding of how psychological, familial, and environmental factors influence noncardiac chest pain. In this investigation, a number of variables that have not been considered in prior research in this area will be included. Among these child variables are: the children's pain coping strategies, the children's somatization behaviors aside from chest pain, the children's externalizing symptoms (e.g., symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder), school related problems, social competencies, parental perceptions of the child's vulnerability, functional disability (the degree to which chest pain interferes with normal daily functioning), and the child's health care utilization. Also, a more sensitive quantification of the children's frequency and intensity of chest pain will be collected, as well as information on situations in which the pain occurs. Parent report of child functioning and child self-report will be used to assess children's behavior. The parental factors to be assessed include the parents' own physical conditions and health care utilization, as well as the parents' psychological functioning. The amount of changes and stress the family as a whole has experienced in different domains will also be assessed as well. Measures of these constructs, as well as children's anxiety and depression (similar to Lipsitz et al. reviewed above) will be collected at the time of the original appointment. With the exception of the chest pain measure, quantification of these variables will be collected for both chest pain and innocent murmur patients between the ages of 8 and 18 years of age at the time of their initial appointment. Further, approximately one month following the medical assessment by the cardiologists, the parents and children will be asked to complete a measure of their satisfaction with the medical care they were provided, their health care utilization subsequent to the diagnostic cardiology appointment, their various somatic symptoms, and their functional disability at the one month follow-up assessment. Also, the chest pain patients will be asked to complete the chest pain inventory in conjunction with their parent. Between-group analyses will address how these multiple variables differ for the chest pain group and patients presenting for an evaluation for heart murmurs. This will be true at both the time of the patients' appointment and at follow-up. Further, within-group correlational analyses will be conducted primarily for with the chest pain group. The goal of these within group analyses will be to address how the various child, parent, and familial factors correlate with the children's chest pain symptoms, healthcare utilization, other somatic symptoms, and functional disability. In addition, for the chest pain group, the patients' and their families' functioning at the time of the initial appointment will be used to predict chest pain and other somatic symptom maintenance, health care utilization following the initial appointment, and satisfaction with their medical care at follow-up. Each of these questions will advance the literature in this area. We should also point out why the innocent murmur group was chosen as a comparison sample for the chest pain patients. As noted above, pain is a subjective experience that is first noted by the patient and then communicated to others. It is then reacted to in various ways by those in the child's environment. In contrast, a child with a heart murmur is not the one who first notices the symptom and then communicates it. Instead, the patient with a murmur is told that they have the symptom by a pediatrician, family practice physician, or other health care provider. This tendency to notice and interpret pain in a particular manner is an essential component in the history of the children and their families who report to cardiology clinics for an evaluation of the etiology of chest pain. Such noticing and interpretation is fundamentally a psychological process. Comparison: adolescents who present in a cardiac specialty clinic with noncardiac chest pain versus those who present with innocent murmurs.'}</td>\n",

Active approaches are directed towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest wall or the cervical and thoracic spine (20%). The diagnostic approaches and treatment options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches. Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute, musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting self-management. Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the patients are randomized into one of two groups: A) advice promoting self-management and individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B) a course of chiropractic therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment.', 'detailed_description': 'BACKGROUND Acute chest pain is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission.(Bechgaard, 1982) In Denmark alone, more than 30,000 patients are admitted to medical departments because of chest pain.(Fruergaard, 1992) In the United States chest pain is the reason for 20-30 percent of all acute medical hospital admissions.(Capewell, 2000) However, an estimated 5-20 percent of all admissions to acute chest pain departments are caused by chest pain of musculoskeletal origin.(Knockaert 2002; Spalding 2003; Fruergaard 1996) Chest pain patients with normal coronary anatomy have an excellent prognosis for survival and a future risk of cardiac morbidity similar to that reported in the background population.(Berman 1999; Klocke 2003) However, about three quarters of patients with non-cardiac chest pain continue to suffer from residual chest pain with large socio-economic consequences.(Spalding 2003; Launbjerg 1997; Ockene 1980; Eslick 2002; Tew 1995; Wielgosz 1984; Achem 2000) An extensive body of literature addresses patient management protocols for patients presenting with chest pain primarily focusing on cardiopulmonary, gastroesophageal, and psychological conditions causing chest symptoms, but treatment protocols of musculoskeletal chest pain remain, however, scarce. Neither the effect of medical treatment (oral anti-inflammatory drug), exercise (strength and/or stretching), nor advice have been investigated. In particular, there is a lack of formal clinical studies examining the effectiveness of manual/manipulative approaches to manage musculoskeletal chest pain. To the best of the authors knowledge, only one study exists that deal with this aspect.(Christensen, 2005) Therefore, the aim of this single-blind randomized clinical trial is to compare the effect of chiropractic treatment versus advice directed towards promoting self-management in a population of patients with musculoskeletal chest pain using standardized outcome measures. Further, a cost-effectiveness analysis along side the RCT will be performed. METHODS Design: Single-blinded Randomized Trial. Study sample: The patients are recruited from a university hospital chest pain clinic. The chest pain clinic is part of a large specialized cardiology department. All patients undergo a standardized evaluation program ruling out acute coronary syndrome and any other obvious and significant cardiac or non-cardiac disease. Sixty patients are to be included in each of the two intervention groups, totaling 120 participants. The patients are included as a part of a larger study on diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain. Examination and baseline data: Following discharge from the chest pain clinic, all patient records are screened for the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, and potential participants are invited to participate. Within 7 days, participants are assessed in an individual baseline test. First, they complete a battery of questionnaires including information on social, occupation, education, physical and lifestyle factors, expectation to treatment outcome, and baseline values for the outcome measure (see below). Signed consent forms are obtained from all participants. Next, patients with musculoskeletal chest pain will be identified using a standardized examination protocol. The examination protocol consists of 3 parts: 1) a semi-structured interview (including pain characteristics, symptoms from the lungs and gastrointestinal system, the past medical history, height and weight, and risk factors of ischemic heart disease), 2) a general health examination (including blood pressure and pulse, heart and lung stethoscopy, abdominal palpation, neck auscultation, and clinical signs of left ventricular failure, neurological examination of upper and lower extremities in terms of reflexes, sensibility to touch, muscle strength, as well as orthopaedic examination of the neck and shoulder joints in order to rule out nerve root compression syndromes.), and 3) a specific manual examination of the muscles and joints of the neck, thoracic spine and thorax (including active range of motion, manual palpation for muscular tenderness on 14 point of the anterior chest wall, palpation for paraspinal muscular tenderness segmentally, motion palpation for joint-play restriction of the thoracic spine (Th1-8), and end play restriction of the cervical and thoracic spine). The examination program together with the detailed case history will be applied by the clinician to the population of chest pain patients to make a diagnosis of pain from the musculoskeletal system, Cervico-thoracic Angina (CTA). Randomization: Only CTA positive participants draw a sealed, opaque envelope numbered in succession and containing information about treatment allocation. The randomization sequence is computer generated. The envelopes are arranged in clusters of varying size. The examining clinician manages the hand over of the envelope to the participant, but is blind to treatment allocation. Interventions: CTA positive participants will be randomized to receive advice promoting self-management (advice group) or a standard course of chiropractic treatment (therapy group). Advice group: Advice is directed towards promoting self-management. The participants are told that their chest pain generally has a benign, self limiting course. The participants receive individual instructions regarding posture and two or three exercises aiming to increase spinal or muscle stretch based on clinical evaluation. They are advised to seek medical attention for re-evaluation (general physician, chest pain clinic or emergency department) in case of severe or unfamiliar chest pain. The session lasts on average 15 minutes. Further, the advice group is also asked not to seek any manual treatment for the next four weeks. Therapy group: Participants in the therapy group undergo a physical examination by an experienced, primary sector chiropractor, lasting up to one hour. The chiropractors choose an individual treatment strategy based on a combination of their findings, the patient history, and a standardized protocol reflecting routine practice. The standardized treatment protocol includes high velocity, low amplitude manipulation directed towards the thoracic and/or cervical spine in combination with any of the following: Joint mobilization, soft tissue techniques, stretching, stabilizing or strengthening exercises, heat or cold treatment, and advice. The protocol specifies up to ten treatment sessions of approximately 20 minutes, 1-3 times per week, or treatment until the patient is pain free. The chiropractors record the types of treatment rendered at sessions. Follow-up: Follow-up data are collected at four weeks, 3 months and one year (Figure 1) Data analyzes: Data will be analyzed by a research group member blinded to group status. The analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle. Both parametric and non parametric principle will be used to compare treatment effects between the groups and to identify baseline predictors for successful treatment outcome. Finally, based on a prior definition of success, numbers needed to treat will be calculated. Cost-effectiveness analysis: A cost comparison of the therapy and advice group will be performed using data on direct and indirect costs. A cost-utility analysis comparing the therapy and advice group will be performed using the EuroQol 5D.'}</td>\n",

This rise and fall is associated with the changing prevalence of respiratory viruses in the population. Myriad respiratory viruses are responsible for these infections. For example, Influenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza Virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus have all been identified as causing such acute infections. Numerous pathogenic subtypes have been identified within most of these viral groups. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was eventually identified as a Coronavirus; the mortality of SARS among the elderly can be as high as 50%. More recently, Human Bocavirus (HBoV) has also been identified as causing acute respiratory tract infections. In 2005 the HBoV was identified by molecular testing and was found to be the only virus identified in a subpopulation of patients suffering from respiratory tract infections. Apart from supportive measure (e.g., bed rest, hydration, etc.), there are no effective treatments for many of these viral infections; however, antiviral agents (e.g., the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir) can be used to alleviate the severity of flu-like symptoms. Identification of a respiratory virus as the causative agent is important because it eliminates the need for treatment with antibiotics; physicians typically wait 7-10 days for symptoms to alleviate before prescribing antibiotics due to risks associated with exacerbating bacterial antibiotic resistance. Each year the virus population fluctuates, and with it the antigenic presentation of the dominant strains that circulate through the population. Epidemics arise when larger and larger portions of the population do not have innate or acquired immunological resistance to such strain(s) in a given season. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a separate website dedicated to tracking outbreaks of influenza, especially avian influenza (https://www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker). These zoonotic transmissions that further adapt to enable human-to-human transmission are of the greatest concern because it is predicted that virtually all humans will be immunologically naïve. Zoonotic transmissions in the human population are monitored in the hope that a pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu of 1918 can be avoided; it is estimated that well over 25 million people died from the Spanish Flu. The United States government also maintains a separate website with resources regarding the flu and pandemic related information (http://www.pandemicflu.gov/). On June 11, 2009 the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 6 in response to the global appearance of a new strain of swine Influenza A (subtype H1N1). The rapidity with which the H1N1 virus has spread exemplifies the notion that quickly and accurately identifying a viral pathogen associated with an outbreak is critical to global public health. In addition to the threat of an influenza outbreak, the expansion in the number of viruses that cause acute respiratory tract infections compounds the difficulty in correctly and rapidly identifying the primary pathogen; each new virus or subtype increases the complexity of testing. Molecular diagnostic assays are ideally suited to address this complexity. Assays based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can incorporate multiple primers and probes (e.g., multiplexed) in a single reaction to deal with this complexity.4 Such assays are extremely sensitive, have a high degree of specificity, and can be performed very quickly. The artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test is a real-time PCR assay for the detection and identification of Influenza A and B, while the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test is a nucleic acid amplification-based assay for the detection and identification of a broad range of some of the most common respiratory viruses associated with acute respiratory tract infections. In the present study respiratory specimens will be prospectively collected and tested using the artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test and the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test.'}</td>\n",

       "      <td>The patient meets exclusion criterion 6, \"O2 Saturation &gt; 92% on room air\", is not directly applicable as there is no O2 saturation value provided in the patient summary. However, the patient's clinical presentation includes \"cyanosis\", which implies low oxygen saturation, but this alone does not directly confirm an exclusion criterion. Yet, considering the provided vital signs and symptoms, none directly match the exclusion criteria provided. But, upon closer examination, the patient's history of a viral illness and current symptoms could suggest a potential for previous morbidity or current condition that might indirectly relate to some criteria. Still, the most direct reason for exclusion based on the given information isn't clearly stated in the criteria. However, the patient's age is mentioned as 10 years old, which does not directly relate to any of the given criteria since the criteria mention \"Age since conception is less than -44 weeks\" which would apply to premature infants and not a 10-year-old. Given the information and the criteria, the best match for exclusion, although not perfectly clear, would be related to previous morbidity or the patient's current condition. Yet, none of the criteria directly state conditions like viral illnesses or the symptoms presented as exclusionary. The closest consideration would be criterion 1 regarding previous morbidity, but the information provided does not clearly link to cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular, nutrition issues, or congenital/acquired airway problems directly. The patient does have symptoms like cough and shortness of breath, which could imply a pulmonary issue, but it's part of the current illness rather than a clear \"previous morbidity.\" Thus, the initial reasoning aimed to identify a clear exclusion based on provided details but found that the information given does not directly align with the exclusion criteria in a manner that unequivocally justifies exclusion based on the explicit language of the criteria. Upon reevaluation for the purpose of this response, it's noted that the process requires identifying a clear reason for exclusion based on the criteria, and the provided patient information does not neatly fit into the exclusion categories as defined. Therefore, the correct approach is to carefully match each criterion against the patient's information, and upon this detailed review, it appears the initial analysis overextended in attempting to align the patient's condition with the criteria without clear, direct evidence. The correct verdict should reflect whether the patient clearly meets any of the specified exclusion criteria, and based on the information provided and the criteria listed, the patient does not clearly fit into the categories of exclusion as explicitly defined. However, the presence of \"cyanosis\" and the patient's respiratory symptoms could suggest a condition impacting oxygen saturation or pulmonary function, but without a direct measure of O2 saturation or explicit diagnosis of a condition listed in the criteria, the exclusion should be based on clear evidence. The patient's current symptoms and history do not provide a clear, direct link to the exclusion criteria as specified, suggesting a need to reconsider the exclusion verdict based on the explicit criteria and the information provided about the patient. Given this, the focus should be on whether any criterion is clearly met, and upon review, the information does not provide a clear, direct match to the exclusion criteria that would unequivocally justify exclusion. Thus, the reasoning process aimed to carefully evaluate each criterion against the patient's clinical information and determine if there's a clear basis for exclusion. Given the criteria and the patient's information, the exclusion verdict should be based on clear, direct evidence of meeting an exclusion criterion, which upon detailed review, is not unequivocally established. The patient's presentation and history do suggest potential health issues, but these do not clearly align with the specified exclusion criteria in a manner that provides a direct, unequivocal reason for exclusion based on the information provided.</td>\n",

In a minority of cases (some of which can be identified in advance by defining risk groups) a serious illness may develop, including risk of respiratory failure and death. Most cases will just require supplemental oxygen and suction of secretions from the nose (as listed in the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics - AAP). However, this apparently \"simple\" treatment still requires continued hospitalization. This results in a sharp increase in bed occupancy in Israeli hospital pediatric departments in the winter months. In recent years two studies from developed countries have been published where safety has been demonstrated for home oxygen treatment for babies with AB. However, feasibility studies have not been published yet, for example for populations living in poor conditions.

Evidence from different randomized controlled trials, however, had challenged the actual amount of clinical benefit achievable by fever suppression for improving the patients' comfort and behavior. On the other hand, evidence from animal and human challenge studies has suggested that antipyretic therapy may actually prolong the duration of illness, suppress humoral antibody response, and increase the level and duration of viral shedding. The knowledge gap: Most of the currently available evidence on the harms and benefits of antipyretic treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are from either experimental animal studies, or human challenge studies with various respiratory viruses, or from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on patients with fever of presumed viral origin. There has yet been no RCT that has investigated on the effect of antipyretics on the clinical course, disease duration, and the pattern of viral shedding in naturally occurring acute URTIs of viral origin in humans. Whereas acute URTIs can be caused by a range of viral and non-viral causes, influenza virus infection is one of its leading cause, and its pathogenesis is relatively well understood compared to some other respiratory viruses. Aim: To investigate the potential benefits and risks of antipyretic use in naturally occurring influenza virus infections in humans. Design and subjects: The study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Four hundred young adults aged 18-30 years will be recruited when they present with symptoms of acute respiratory infection within 48 hours of symptoms onset to university health clinics, and being tested positive with a QuickVue rapid influenza test. They will receive their clinical consultation and prescriptions as indicated as usual, and being randomized to receive either paracetamol or placebo, and given back-up NSAID for intolerable fever when required. Blood specimen, nasal and throat swabs will be collected on the same day (day 1). They will be followed-up on day 4, day 7 and day 10 for further collection of nasal and throat swabs, and on day 28 for a final blood taking. A symptom diary will be kept by each participant for 10 days for monitoring the clinical course of the infection. Potential significance: This will be the first RCT to investigate the effect of antipyretics on the clinical course, disease duration, and the pattern of viral shedding in naturally occurring influenza virus infection in humans. Findings from this study will have important contribution to our understanding on the role of fever as a host defense mechanism, and help to inform the appropriate clinical management approach in human influenza virus infection.'}</td>\n",

Investigate the depression, anxiety and stress scores (DASS21) and quality of life scored (QOL) by parents of the children during admission, pre-discharge and post discharge and at follow-ups.', 'detailed_description': 'Introduction: Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in children less than 5 years old and these are preventable deaths.[1,2] It is also an important cause of morbidity , especially when it is recurrent or severe as it may be linked with future adult lung disease.[3] Determining the aetiology of pneumonia is difficult in children who cannot produce satisfactory sputum for culture. Hence the reliance on molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Enzyme immunoassays(EIA) looking at serological rise to determine the true aetiology of pneumonia is important especially in the era where mixed infections are common and may be associated with severe infections. There is currently no information on the suitable duration of antibiotics for uncomplicated severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is also rampant overuse of antibiotics that results in poor compliance and significant side effects. There is little information on the QOL of the child with severe pneumonia and his parent. It is important to have a holistic approach to medicine hence the importance of analyzing the burden and social issues associated with children admitted with pneumonia. As opposed to adults, children cannot produce sputum (lower respiratory sample) appropriate for culture which is the traditional method of identifying the causative bacteria. Identification of bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (upper respiratory sample) does not equate to that organism causing the infection as the upper airway of a child is often colonized by bacteria. Detecting the organism in blood identifies it as the causative organism. However, blood culture has a very low yield in children with pneumonia and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is much more sensitive at detecting bacteria in blood and hence it will markedly improve the ability to determine infecting organism. Development of our own in-house bacterial PCR kit which will detect several different bacteria in blood is planned in this study. We already have an in-house viral PCR kit and the ability to detect atypical bacteria via EIA. Currently there is an international study (Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health [PERCH]) looking at aetiology of pneumonia, but this study only involves 2 Asian countries (Thailand and Bangladesh)[5]. In Malaysia, in 2011 there was a study that looked at pneumococcal isolates and antibiotic sensitivity patterns on invasive pneumococcal disease only[6]. There are also studies that look at viral aetiology of pneumonia[7]. Hence information on aetiology of pneumonia is skewed to those involving vaccine associated organisms and use of nasopharyngeal secretions(NPS) to detect viruses.. The evidence for appropriate duration of antibiotics that should be used in hospitalized children with pneumonia is scarce. A randomized controlled trial comparing traditional duration of antibiotics (&gt;= 7 days) versus shorter duration of antibiotics &lt; 7 days) is what we think is necessary. There are no studies looking at duration of antibiotics in children with severe uncomplicated pneumonia. We hypothesize that there is no need for a longer duration of antibiotics which are only associated with poor compliance and unnecessary side-effects. Finally, there is little data on quality of life in children and parents during and after a pneumonic episode. It is important to measure the impact of such a common disease on both parent and patient as well as to assess the impact of medical management on QOL so as to have a more holistic approach to medicine. Two previous studies have looked at QOL. One was a study comparing all acute diseases to chronic diseases[8]. The other looked at CAP but without the use of structured questionnaires[9] Methodology Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial Children aged 3 months till &lt;5 years old Admitted to University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) hospital with a severe community acquired pneumonia Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: 3 Months to 59 Months Genders Eligible for Study: Both Inclusion Criteria: Children admitted with severe pneumonia as defined by the presence of all the following as defined as below: - 3 months to 59 months old - History of cough and/or shortness of breath Unwell for &lt;= 7 days - Increased respiratory rate ( &gt;= 50/min if &lt;=12 months old, &gt;= 40/min) - Any of the following signs/symptoms are present at examination that would necessitate admission: chest retractions, cyanosis, saturation&lt; 92% on air, poor feeding or lethargy - Documented fever (axillary /central temp &gt;= 38/38.5°C) within 24 hrs of admission - Abnormal chest radio graph(CXR) with presence of alveolar infiltrates - Responds to IV antibiotics by the first 72 hrs and able to go home with oral antibiotics i.e. no more hypoxia and afebrile and reduced respiratory symptoms Exclusion Criteria: Children who (a) are transferred from another hospital (b) refuse blood taking (c) have a doctor diagnosis of asthma or recurrent wheezing illness (d) have a diagnosis of bronchiolitis i.e. wheezing in a child with a CXR with no consolidation (e) do not have an acute illness ( ie &gt;7 days) (f) are unable to come for follow-up (g) do not have community acquired pneumonia e.g. aspiration pneumonia (h)have a complicated pneumonia with effusion, pneumothorax, clinical suspicion of necrotizing pneumonia (i)require paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission or use of non-invasive ventilation (j)significant comorbidities that can increase the risk of having a complicated pneumonia- (k) need other antibiotics like anti-staph or macrolides (l)have an extra-pulmonary infection e.g. meningitis (m)are allergic to penicillin (n) are unable to tolerate oral antibiotics and (o)have underlying illness that can predispose to recurrent pneumonia Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial Children aged 3 months till &lt;5 years old Admitted to UMMC hospital with a severe community acquired pneumonia Informed signed consent will be obtained from parents first. All children will have full blood count and CXR taken Additional blood and urine as detailed below will also be taken: a. Blood for PCR -streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pnuemoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae will be taken. NPS for respiratory bacteria and viruses (by culture and PCT-similar as above) All these samples will be tested in our hospital laboratory. If samples cannot be processed immediately, they will be stored in a -80 deg C freezer except for the NPS for bacterial culture. All data will be collected at enrollment and at each follow-up visit on a standardized data sheet. Baseline demographic data( age, gender, address, ethnicity, household size, income, parent education, caregivers, household appliances) and medical information( birth history, breastfeeding and weaning, growth, immunization, smoke exposure, co-morbidity, daily hospitalization information) will be obtained from parents and medical charts. CXRs and routine blood test results will also be recorded. Quality of life, stress level, severity of illness , of parents and children with pneumonia, will be assessed at these time points too: during their admission (average of 3-5 days) and during follow-ups( average at, 4 weeks, 3 months(phone call only with no questionnaire administered), 6 months, 1 year post their pneumonic episode) using the following questionnaires-Paediatric proxy cough quality of life-8 (PCQOL-8), Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu Scale (CARIFS) (in hospital only), cough diary( at home, daily for 1 month),Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21( DASS21). The PCQOL-8 and DASS21 have been translated and validated in Bahasa Melayu. The CARIFS and the cough diary was recently translated in Bahasa Melayu and piloted for the purpose of this study. Treatments will be administered only after at least 48-72 hrs of intravenous(IV) antibiotics ( penicillin/ampicillin/ amoxicillin-clavulanate acid/cefuroxime) and the patients are ready for discharge : afebrile, improved respiratory symptoms and signs, saturation &gt; 92% in air and ready to be converted to oral antibiotics. Arm 1: Twice a day oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (22.5mg/kg/dose) for 10 days Arm 2: Twice a day oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (22.5mg/kg/dose) for 3 days followed by oral placebo for 7 days The random treatments will be allocated via computer generated number sequence and will be supervised by a statistician. All medications will be prepared and dispensed by the pharmacy department in suspension form. The appearance of the placebo will be similar to the active medication. Investigators and subjects will be blinded. At discharge, parents will be asked to fill up a daily cough diary at home. Treatment failure/exit criteria will be fulfilled if any of the following occur: death, recrudescence of fever &gt;=38 °C (axilla) with respiratory signs of pneumonia, hypoxaemia &lt; 92% on air), need for antibiotic treatment, new CXR changes. On discharge, children will be followed up at regular intervals of 4 weeks, 3 moths(phone call), 6 months and 1 year, to ensure they are well and also to detect residual or recurring respiratory symptoms i.e. presence of cough/breathlessness/fever, recrudescence of pneumonia and other respiratory illness, fever and upper respiratory tract infection(URTI), growth, need for unscheduled healthcare visits for respiratory symptoms, need for antibiotic treatments for respiratory/upper airway symptoms, abnormal physical findings, over a period of 1 year post-discharge from hospital. Adverse effects of antibiotics e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and adherence (returned empty bottles) to medication will be recorded. CXR will be repeated at 4 weeks and at 1 year(if clinically indicated). These will be scored by a radiologist who will be masked to allotted treatment. At 12 months, if the age allows it, children will be asked to perform lung function tests. During these follow-ups they will be given questionnaires: PCQOL-8, DASS21. At the 4 week discharge, CXR as well as blood and NPS will be collected for testing for bacterial and viral organisms. At 4 weeks, daily cough diaries will be collected back and reviewed. Sample size calculation is based on the primary aim. We expect a 20% superiority difference in the extended antibiotic regime and assuming a 20% drop-out, sample size should be 204 children (102 in each arm). Data will be presented in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines on reporting on RCTs. Analysis will be done by Dr. Rafdzah, a statistician. An intention to treat approach will be used for all analyses. For the primary aim i.e. the clinical outcome of the different antibiotic durations, the main outcomes being looked at are (a) clinical cure-complete resolution of symptoms and signs at 4 weeks ,(b) proportion of children without chronic respiratory symptoms or signs at the 12 month follow-up , using odds ratio(95%CI) with logistic regression and linear regression. For continuous variables, t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests will be used depending on the normality of the data. A Kaplan-Meier curve will be constructed for each group for the time to next respiratory illness and hospitalization and proportions will be compared by regression models. For prevalence of respiratory pathogens, point prevalence will be reported on and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for baseline carriage and antibiotic resistance will examine the effects of treatment duration on the different organisms particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and Staph aureus.'}</td>\n",

The trial excludes subjects where the duration of the symptoms of such an acute respiratory infection is greater than or equal to 5 days. The patient's symptoms started after a previous diagnosis of a viral illness two weeks ago, indicating that the duration of the symptoms is greater than or equal to 5 days, thus meeting the exclusion criterion.   \n",
       "3852  The patient meets exclusion criterion 6, \"O2 Saturation > 92% on room air\", is not directly applicable as there is no O2 saturation value provided in the patient summary. However, the patient's clinical presentation includes \"cyanosis\", which implies low oxygen saturation, but this alone does not directly confirm an exclusion criterion. Yet, considering the provided vital signs and symptoms, none directly match the exclusion criteria provided. But, upon closer examination, the patient's history of a viral illness and current symptoms could suggest a potential for previous morbidity or current condition that might indirectly relate to some criteria. Still, the most direct reason for exclusion based on the given information isn't clearly stated in the criteria. However, the patient's age is mentioned as 10 years old, which does not directly relate to any of the given criteria since the criteria mention \"Age since conception is less than -44 weeks\" which would apply to premature infants and not a 10-year-old. Given the information and the criteria, the best match for exclusion, although not perfectly clear, would be related to previous morbidity or the patient's current condition. Yet, none of the criteria directly state conditions like viral illnesses or the symptoms presented as exclusionary. The closest consideration would be criterion 1 regarding previous morbidity, but the information provided does not clearly link to cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular, nutrition issues, or congenital/acquired airway problems directly. The patient does have symptoms like cough and shortness of breath, which could imply a pulmonary issue, but it's part of the current illness rather than a clear \"previous morbidity.\" Thus, the initial reasoning aimed to identify a clear exclusion based on provided details but found that the information given does not directly align with the exclusion criteria in a manner that unequivocally justifies exclusion based on the explicit language of the criteria. Upon reevaluation for the purpose of this response, it's noted that the process requires identifying a clear reason for exclusion based on the criteria, and the provided patient information does not neatly fit into the exclusion categories as defined. Therefore, the correct approach is to carefully match each criterion against the patient's information, and upon this detailed review, it appears the initial analysis overextended in attempting to align the patient's condition with the criteria without clear, direct evidence. The correct verdict should reflect whether the patient clearly meets any of the specified exclusion criteria, and based on the information provided and the criteria listed, the patient does not clearly fit into the categories of exclusion as explicitly defined. However, the presence of \"cyanosis\" and the patient's respiratory symptoms could suggest a condition impacting oxygen saturation or pulmonary function, but without a direct measure of O2 saturation or explicit diagnosis of a condition listed in the criteria, the exclusion should be based on clear evidence. The patient's current symptoms and history do not provide a clear, direct link to the exclusion criteria as specified, suggesting a need to reconsider the exclusion verdict based on the explicit criteria and the information provided about the patient. Given this, the focus should be on whether any criterion is clearly met, and upon review, the information does not provide a clear, direct match to the exclusion criteria that would unequivocally justify exclusion. Thus, the reasoning process aimed to carefully evaluate each criterion against the patient's clinical information and determine if there's a clear basis for exclusion. Given the criteria and the patient's information, the exclusion verdict should be based on clear, direct evidence of meeting an exclusion criterion, which upon detailed review, is not unequivocally established. The patient's presentation and history do suggest potential health issues, but these do not clearly align with the specified exclusion criteria in a manner that provides a direct, unequivocal reason for exclusion based on the information provided.   \n",

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and the physical examination finding of cyanosis suggest an active lung disease requiring attention, which aligns with the exclusion criterion of \"Have any history of chronic liver disease, or any active lung, heart or renal diseases requiring regular medication.\" Specifically, the criterion mentions \"any active lung... diseases,\" and the patient's current respiratory symptoms and findings could imply an active lung condition.   \n",

Additionally, the patient's symptoms started after a previous diagnosis of a viral illness two weeks ago, and the current presentation with low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea experienced two weeks ago, along with the elevated WBC count with eosinophilia, may suggest a complex or complicated clinical picture. However, the most direct exclusion is criterion (c) \"have a doctor diagnosis of asthma or recurrent wheezing illness\" is not met based on provided information, but criterion (o) \"underlying illness that can predispose to recurrent pneumonia\" could be considered due to the patient's recent viral illness and current symptoms, yet it's the combination of severe symptoms that leans towards a complicated condition. The explicit information about the patient's condition, such as cyanosis and elevated WBC with eosinophilia, in the context of recent viral illness and current severe symptoms, suggests a complicated pneumonia, thus meeting criterion (h).   \n",

However, the patient summary indicates that the patient is a 58-year-old woman, which clearly falls outside the specified age range. Although the patient is experiencing chest pain, which aligns with one of the inclusion criteria, the age criterion is not met, leading to a verdict of FAIL. Other criteria such as English speaking and specific conditions like innocent heart murmurs are not directly addressed in the patient summary, but the age criterion alone is sufficient to determine ineligibility.   \n",

There is also no documentation of coronary artery disease, previous treatment with beta-blockers, or results from an exercise tolerance test. The patient's symptoms and diagnostic test results (e.g., EKG showing nonspecific changes) do not confirm the presence of chronic stable angina or coronary artery disease. Furthermore, there is no mention of the patient being on any beta-blocker therapy or having undergone an exercise tolerance test. Therefore, the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial.   \n",

       "3840  The patient is 10 years old, which does not meet the age criterion of being at least 18 years old (or 17 if active military) as specified in the trial inclusion criteria. Additionally, there is no information provided about the patient's hemoglobin level, which is required to be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL before starting IV Ribavirin. Lastly, while the patient has been exposed to domestic pigs on a farm and has symptoms like myalgia, cough, and shortness of breath, the information provided does not clearly meet the case definition for a probable or suspected case of CCHF or LF as outlined in the trial criteria.

This study was created to determine whether there is a relationship between sex and body size and the incidence of heart disease in African American men and women. Researchers will attempt to associate obesity with the presence of heart disease risk factors. Risk factors that will be studied include; total body fat, body fat distribution, fat content of the blood (triglyceride concentration, low density lipoproteins [LDL], and high density lipoproteins [HDL]), how fast fat is removed from the blood, and how well insulin works in the body. Scientific studies have shown that obesity and increased levels of fat content in the blood are important risk factors for heart disease in Caucasian women. However, similar studies in African American women have failed to show the same correlation. In fact, it appears that African American women in all three body weight groupings, nonobese, overweight, and obese experience high death rates due to heart disease. In addition, prior research has shown that obese African American men tend to have elevated levels of fat in the blood while African American women have normal blood fat levels. Therefore, if high levels of triglycerides (fat found in the blood) are not seen in non-diabetic obese African American women, it cannot be considered a risk factor in this population. This suggests that studies conducted on Caucasian women may not provide insight into heart disease risk factors in African American women. The study will take 120 healthy nondiabetic African American men and women (ages 18-50) grouped by sex (60 men and 60 women) and body mass index 3 subgroups; nonobese, overweight and obese). Diabetes undeniably increases the risk of heart disease. Therefore patients suffering from diabetes will not be included in the study. Candidates for the study will undergo a series of tests and examinations over 5 outpatient visits. Subjects will have body fat analyses, resting energy expenditure measurements, an EKG (electrocardiogram), and specific blood tests. Researchers believe this study will provide significant insight into the causes of obesity and heart disease in African Americans.', 'detailed_description': 'This study is designed to investigate in blacks the relationship of risk for diabetes and heart disease from obesity plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations and the triglyceride related risk factors of small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and central obesity. The Framingham Study demonstrated that obesity and elevated glucose and triglyceride levels are important risk factors for coronary artery disease in white women. However, studies that have had significant participation of black women such as the Charleston Heart Study, failed to show a relationship of obesity or triglyceride to coronary artery disease mortality in black women. In fact, black women independent of body weight or triglyceride levels experience high mortality from coronary artery disease. Our earlier research has demonstrated that obese black men have elevated triglyceride levels but obese black women have normal triglyceride levels. Consequently if elevated triglyceride levels do not occur in obese nondiabetic black women, then elevated triglyceride levels may not represent a major cardiovascular risk for black women. The study, Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk in Blacks, is designed to determine the role of obesity, glucose and triglyceride on risk for heart disease in blacks. For this study of blacks, we will study 2 groups, African Americans and Black Africans living in the United States. African Americans must self-identify as African American, be born in the United States and have parents who self-identify as African American and were born in the United States. The second group will be blacks living in the United States but were born in Africa and whose parents were born in Africa. We will recruit 1132 healthy, non-diabetic individuals (546 men, 586 women), age range 18-65, and body mass index (3 subgroups: nonobese, overweight and obese). We need to recruit more women than men because triglyceride and glucose levels are lower in women than men. Therefore a larger number of women are needed to see an effect. In 3 outpatient visits to the Clinical Center, participants will have body fat analyses, an electrocardiogram, an oral glucose tolerance test, questionnaires about sleep and stress and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. This study has the potential to provide significant insight and lead to the development of programs that help decrease diabetes and cardiovascular risk in blacks.'}   \n",

heart murmurs - Pediatric patients experiencing chest pain - English speaking', 'exclusion_criteria': '- Non English speaking patients', 'brief_summary': 'The causes of pediatric pain are often not the same for every child. Most children who visit a cardiology specialist with complaints of chest or other somatic pain have no known medical diagnosis to explain their symptoms. These children and their families often leave with no explanation for the child's distress. This early study will ask parents and children specific questions related to the stress in their lives, their emotional well-being and the children's physical functioning. The investigators want children who experience chest and other somatic pain, and those who do not, to be in their study so that they can look at both groups. The investigators hope to use these answers to better inform cardiologists who often work with children with non-cardiac pain and, in turn, help them to better serve their patients. Ultimately, the investigators hope that the answers they get will provide answers to these families. They also hope to use the results of this study to put together a short screener for the cardiologist to give to pediatric patients with complaints of chest or other somatic pain to help the cardiologists better understand their patients' symptoms.', 'detailed_description': 'The current investigation will address some similar factors considered in prior research, but will considerably extend our understanding of how psychological, familial, and environmental factors influence noncardiac chest pain. In this investigation, a number of variables that have not been considered in prior research in this area will be included. Among these child variables are: the children's pain coping strategies, the children's somatization behaviors aside from chest pain, the children's externalizing symptoms (e.g., symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder), school related problems, social competencies, parental perceptions of the child's vulnerability, functional disability (the degree to which chest pain interferes with normal daily functioning), and the child's health care utilization. Also, a more sensitive quantification of the children's frequency and intensity of chest pain will be collected, as well as information on situations in which the pain occurs. Parent report of child functioning and child self-report will be used to assess children's behavior. The parental factors to be assessed include the parents' own physical conditions and health care utilization, as well as the parents' psychological functioning. The amount of changes and stress the family as a whole has experienced in different domains will also be assessed as well. Measures of these constructs, as well as children's anxiety and depression (similar to Lipsitz et al. reviewed above) will be collected at the time of the original appointment. With the exception of the chest pain measure, quantification of these variables will be collected for both chest pain and innocent murmur patients between the ages of 8 and 18 years of age at the time of their initial appointment. Further, approximately one month following the medical assessment by the cardiologists, the parents and children will be asked to complete a measure of their satisfaction with the medical care they were provided, their health care utilization subsequent to the diagnostic cardiology appointment, their various somatic symptoms, and their functional disability at the one month follow-up assessment. Also, the chest pain patients will be asked to complete the chest pain inventory in conjunction with their parent. Between-group analyses will address how these multiple variables differ for the chest pain group and patients presenting for an evaluation for heart murmurs. This will be true at both the time of the patients' appointment and at follow-up. Further, within-group correlational analyses will be conducted primarily for with the chest pain group. The goal of these within group analyses will be to address how the various child, parent, and familial factors correlate with the children's chest pain symptoms, healthcare utilization, other somatic symptoms, and functional disability. In addition, for the chest pain group, the patients' and their families' functioning at the time of the initial appointment will be used to predict chest pain and other somatic symptom maintenance, health care utilization following the initial appointment, and satisfaction with their medical care at follow-up. Each of these questions will advance the literature in this area. We should also point out why the innocent murmur group was chosen as a comparison sample for the chest pain patients. As noted above, pain is a subjective experience that is first noted by the patient and then communicated to others. It is then reacted to in various ways by those in the child's environment. In contrast, a child with a heart murmur is not the one who first notices the symptom and then communicates it. Instead, the patient with a murmur is told that they have the symptom by a pediatrician, family practice physician, or other health care provider. This tendency to notice and interpret pain in a particular manner is an essential component in the history of the children and their families who report to cardiology clinics for an evaluation of the etiology of chest pain. Such noticing and interpretation is fundamentally a psychological process.

'brief_summary': 'African American women have higher rates of obesity than women of any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. Obesity can have many causes, including genetic and environmental factors. This study will examine how neighborhood environments influence the occurrence of obesity among African American women.', 'detailed_description': 'Obesity, which leads to higher rates of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, is an increasingly important public health problem. In 2000, over 78% of African American women were overweight, and over 50% were obese. Several factors can contribute to obesity, including genetics, diet, and environmental factors. Individuals who live in an environment in which it is difficult to maintain an active lifestyle are more prone to obesity. The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) is an extensive long-term study that is gathering data from women across the country to examine the occurrence of various diseases among African American women. Using BWHS study data and specific information on participants' neighborhoods, including street layout and the presence of sidewalks, this study will determine if neighborhood environments influence the prevalence of obesity among African American women. This study will use already-collected data on physical activity and body mass index of BWHS study participants who live in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago; there are no additional study visits specifically for this study.

Active approaches are directed towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest wall or the cervical and thoracic spine (20%). The diagnostic approaches and treatment options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches. Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute, musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting self-management. Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the patients are randomized into one of two groups: A) advice promoting self-management and individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B) a course of chiropractic therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment.', 'detailed_description': 'BACKGROUND Acute chest pain is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission.(Bechgaard, 1982) In Denmark alone, more than 30,000 patients are admitted to medical departments because of chest pain.(Fruergaard, 1992) In the United States chest pain is the reason for 20-30 percent of all acute medical hospital admissions.(Capewell, 2000) However, an estimated 5-20 percent of all admissions to acute chest pain departments are caused by chest pain of musculoskeletal origin.(Knockaert 2002; Spalding 2003; Fruergaard 1996) Chest pain patients with normal coronary anatomy have an excellent prognosis for survival and a future risk of cardiac morbidity similar to that reported in the background population.(Berman 1999; Klocke 2003) However, about three quarters of patients with non-cardiac chest pain continue to suffer from residual chest pain with large socio-economic consequences.(Spalding 2003; Launbjerg 1997; Ockene 1980; Eslick 2002; Tew 1995; Wielgosz 1984; Achem 2000) An extensive body of literature addresses patient management protocols for patients presenting with chest pain primarily focusing on cardiopulmonary, gastroesophageal, and psychological conditions causing chest symptoms, but treatment protocols of musculoskeletal chest pain remain, however, scarce. Neither the effect of medical treatment (oral anti-inflammatory drug), exercise (strength and/or stretching), nor advice have been investigated. In particular, there is a lack of formal clinical studies examining the effectiveness of manual/manipulative approaches to manage musculoskeletal chest pain. To the best of the authors knowledge, only one study exists that deal with this aspect.(Christensen, 2005) Therefore, the aim of this single-blind randomized clinical trial is to compare the effect of chiropractic treatment versus advice directed towards promoting self-management in a population of patients with musculoskeletal chest pain using standardized outcome measures. Further, a cost-effectiveness analysis along side the RCT will be performed. METHODS Design: Single-blinded Randomized Trial. Study sample: The patients are recruited from a university hospital chest pain clinic. The chest pain clinic is part of a large specialized cardiology department. All patients undergo a standardized evaluation program ruling out acute coronary syndrome and any other obvious and significant cardiac or non-cardiac disease. Sixty patients are to be included in each of the two intervention groups, totaling 120 participants. The patients are included as a part of a larger study on diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain. Examination and baseline data: Following discharge from the chest pain clinic, all patient records are screened for the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, and potential participants are invited to participate. Within 7 days, participants are assessed in an individual baseline test. First, they complete a battery of questionnaires including information on social, occupation, education, physical and lifestyle factors, expectation to treatment outcome, and baseline values for the outcome measure (see below). Signed consent forms are obtained from all participants. Next, patients with musculoskeletal chest pain will be identified using a standardized examination protocol. The examination protocol consists of 3 parts: 1) a semi-structured interview (including pain characteristics, symptoms from the lungs and gastrointestinal system, the past medical history, height and weight, and risk factors of ischemic heart disease), 2) a general health examination (including blood pressure and pulse, heart and lung stethoscopy, abdominal palpation, neck auscultation, and clinical signs of left ventricular failure, neurological examination of upper and lower extremities in terms of reflexes, sensibility to touch, muscle strength, as well as orthopaedic examination of the neck and shoulder joints in order to rule out nerve root compression syndromes.), and 3) a specific manual examination of the muscles and joints of the neck, thoracic spine and thorax (including active range of motion, manual palpation for muscular tenderness on 14 point of the anterior chest wall, palpation for paraspinal muscular tenderness segmentally, motion palpation for joint-play restriction of the thoracic spine (Th1-8), and end play restriction of the cervical and thoracic spine). The examination program together with the detailed case history will be applied by the clinician to the population of chest pain patients to make a diagnosis of pain from the musculoskeletal system, Cervico-thoracic Angina (CTA). Randomization: Only CTA positive participants draw a sealed, opaque envelope numbered in succession and containing information about treatment allocation. The randomization sequence is computer generated. The envelopes are arranged in clusters of varying size. The examining clinician manages the hand over of the envelope to the participant, but is blind to treatment allocation. Interventions: CTA positive participants will be randomized to receive advice promoting self-management (advice group) or a standard course of chiropractic treatment (therapy group). Advice group: Advice is directed towards promoting self-management. The participants are told that their chest pain generally has a benign, self limiting course. The participants receive individual instructions regarding posture and two or three exercises aiming to increase spinal or muscle stretch based on clinical evaluation. They are advised to seek medical attention for re-evaluation (general physician, chest pain clinic or emergency department) in case of severe or unfamiliar chest pain. The session lasts on average 15 minutes. Further, the advice group is also asked not to seek any manual treatment for the next four weeks. Therapy group: Participants in the therapy group undergo a physical examination by an experienced, primary sector chiropractor, lasting up to one hour. The chiropractors choose an individual treatment strategy based on a combination of their findings, the patient history, and a standardized protocol reflecting routine practice. The standardized treatment protocol includes high velocity, low amplitude manipulation directed towards the thoracic and/or cervical spine in combination with any of the following: Joint mobilization, soft tissue techniques, stretching, stabilizing or strengthening exercises, heat or cold treatment, and advice. The protocol specifies up to ten treatment sessions of approximately 20 minutes, 1-3 times per week, or treatment until the patient is pain free. The chiropractors record the types of treatment rendered at sessions. Follow-up: Follow-up data are collected at four weeks, 3 months and one year (Figure 1) Data analyzes: Data will be analyzed by a research group member blinded to group status. The analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle. Both parametric and non parametric principle will be used to compare treatment effects between the groups and to identify baseline predictors for successful treatment outcome. Finally, based on a prior definition of success, numbers needed to treat will be calculated. Cost-effectiveness analysis: A cost comparison of the therapy and advice group will be performed using data on direct and indirect costs. A cost-utility analysis comparing the therapy and advice group will be performed using the EuroQol 5D.'}   \n",

cross-match ordered for transfusion. - Agrees to collection of required specimens. - Agrees to report any Adverse Events, Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events for the duration of the study. - Agrees to a follow-up visit and to donate blood and urine specimens at day 14 (±2 days) and once between days 28 and 60 after the first dose of IV Ribavirin and to all follow-up visits for anemia or other medical conditions as required by the attending physician. - Woman of childbearing age must have a pregnancy test performed. If negative, she must agree not to become pregnant during treatment and for 7 months after receiving Ribavirin. She also must agree to not breast feed during treatment and for 7 months after receiving Ribavirin. Two reliable forms of effective contraception must be used including one barrier method during treatment and during the 7 month post-treatment period. She will be counseled concerning the risks of IV Ribavirin versus no treatment if the pregnancy test is positive. - Man agrees not to have intercourse with pregnant woman during treatment and for 7 months after receiving Ribavirin, and take precautions to avoid producing pregnancies during treatment and for 7 months after receiving Ribavirin. At least two reliable forms of effective contraception must be used including one barrier method during treatment and during the 7 month post-treatment period to avoid a pregnancy. - Has a hemoglobin greater than or equal to10 g/dL before starting IV Ribavirin Note: Malaria should be excluded as a possibility for illness in patients suspected to have VHF. Probable Case of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever: All subjects will have a history of possible exposure to CCHF, either having: - Worked or slept outdoors in the CCHF endemic area within 2 weeks of illness onset, with or without a history of tick-bite or tick exposure, (Endemic area includes, but not necessarily limited to: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, the Kosovo region of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, the whole of Africa, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Crimean region of the Ukraine, Rostov-Don and Astrakhan regions of Russia, and the Xinjiang [northwestern] region of the People's Republic of China), OR - Handled blood or freshly butchered meat of domestic livestock in CCHF endemic area during 2 weeks before the onset of illness, OR - Had direct contact with blood, tissues, secretions, or excretions of a CCHF patient (suspected or confirmed), including laboratory specimens, OR - Worked with the virus in the laboratory setting and have a clinical syndrome consistent with CCHF as defined by: - Acute illness with fever and at least two of these symptoms: myalgia, low back pain, and headache, - And the appearance of three or more of the following five groups of signs/symptoms: - Hemorrhage (one or more petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal tract bleeding), - Elevated AST levels (above the upper limits of normal for the laboratory), - Thrombocytopenia (below the lower limits of normal), - Hypotension (systolic pressure < 90 mm Hg), or - Azotemia, renal failure (serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal). - Prognostic indicators exist for subjects at increased risk of severe CCHF. Any of these indicators occurring in the first 5 days of illness, predict a mortality greater than 90% (Swanepoel et al., 1989).

And have - A negative malaria smear. And have - Signs and symptoms compatible with Lassa fever, either: - Fever plus pharyngitis plus retrosternal pain plus proteinuria (positive predictive value of 81% when these three criteria are met, McCormick et al., 1987a,b),OR - Fever plus unexplained mucosal bleeding, OR - Fever plus unexplained edema of the face and neck, OR - Suspected Case of CCHF or LF - Have a clinical syndrome consistent with CCHF or LF, meeting most of the above criteria of a probable case and the patient has an epidemiological history of potential exposure to the bunyavirus or arenavirus (i.e., recent field duty and/or other individuals in his troop have CCHF or LF).', 'exclusion_criteria': '- Has known intolerance to Ribavirin. - Is irreversibly ill on presentation, as defined by presence of profound shock (shock which does not respond to supportive therapy within 3 hours after admission). - Has hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL that cannot be corrected to 10 g/dL before initiation of IV Ribavirin - Has history of hemoglobinopathies (i.e., sickle-cell anemia or thalassemia major). - Has history of autoimmune hepatitis. - Has a calculated serum creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min. - History of such as second or third degree heart block or sick sinus syndrome and without a pacemaker and no capability of a pacemaker placement or Wolfe-Parkinson-White Syndrome. - A sinus bradycardia of less than 40 beats per minute. - Is currently being treated with Didanosine (ddI). ddI must be discontinued before starting IV Ribavirin. Relative', 'brief_summary': 'This is a Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of Intravenous (IV) Ribavirin in treating patients presenting with a probable or suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever (either Crimean Congo or Lassa Fever) at a military medical treatment hospital. All patients will be treated with a 10 day course of IV Ribavirin if they meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.', 'detailed_description': 'Department of Defense operations have resulted in the deployment of personnel to areas endemic for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF): Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) or Lassa Fever. Unfortunately, beyond supportive care, there is no approved therapy for treating either infection. Previous studies with intravenous (IV) Ribavirin have shown IV Ribavirin as a promising treatment for both infections. This study will provide experience in U.S. Department of Defense associated treatment facilities in the use of IV Ribavirin for the experimental treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers primarily among U.S. Service personnel deployed to disease-endemic areas. The rationale for conducting the study is a) to allow the DoD to gain experience in treating VHF b) to offer this experimental but promising therapy to patients with probable or suspected VHF c) to collect safety data while obtaining experience using Ribavirin.'}   \n",

This rise and fall is associated with the changing prevalence of respiratory viruses in the population. Myriad respiratory viruses are responsible for these infections. For example, Influenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza Virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus have all been identified as causing such acute infections. Numerous pathogenic subtypes have been identified within most of these viral groups. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was eventually identified as a Coronavirus; the mortality of SARS among the elderly can be as high as 50%. More recently, Human Bocavirus (HBoV) has also been identified as causing acute respiratory tract infections. In 2005 the HBoV was identified by molecular testing and was found to be the only virus identified in a subpopulation of patients suffering from respiratory tract infections. Apart from supportive measure (e.g., bed rest, hydration, etc.), there are no effective treatments for many of these viral infections; however, antiviral agents (e.g., the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir) can be used to alleviate the severity of flu-like symptoms. Identification of a respiratory virus as the causative agent is important because it eliminates the need for treatment with antibiotics; physicians typically wait 7-10 days for symptoms to alleviate before prescribing antibiotics due to risks associated with exacerbating bacterial antibiotic resistance. Each year the virus population fluctuates, and with it the antigenic presentation of the dominant strains that circulate through the population. Epidemics arise when larger and larger portions of the population do not have innate or acquired immunological resistance to such strain(s) in a given season. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a separate website dedicated to tracking outbreaks of influenza, especially avian influenza (https://www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker). These zoonotic transmissions that further adapt to enable human-to-human transmission are of the greatest concern because it is predicted that virtually all humans will be immunologically naïve. Zoonotic transmissions in the human population are monitored in the hope that a pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu of 1918 can be avoided; it is estimated that well over 25 million people died from the Spanish Flu. The United States government also maintains a separate website with resources regarding the flu and pandemic related information (http://www.pandemicflu.gov/). On June 11, 2009 the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 6 in response to the global appearance of a new strain of swine Influenza A (subtype H1N1). The rapidity with which the H1N1 virus has spread exemplifies the notion that quickly and accurately identifying a viral pathogen associated with an outbreak is critical to global public health. In addition to the threat of an influenza outbreak, the expansion in the number of viruses that cause acute respiratory tract infections compounds the difficulty in correctly and rapidly identifying the primary pathogen; each new virus or subtype increases the complexity of testing. Molecular diagnostic assays are ideally suited to address this complexity. Assays based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can incorporate multiple primers and probes (e.g., multiplexed) in a single reaction to deal with this complexity.4 Such assays are extremely sensitive, have a high degree of specificity, and can be performed very quickly. The artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test is a real-time PCR assay for the detection and identification of Influenza A and B, while the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test is a nucleic acid amplification-based assay for the detection and identification of a broad range of some of the most common respiratory viruses associated with acute respiratory tract infections. In the present study respiratory specimens will be prospectively collected and tested using the artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test and the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test.'}   \n",

The baby and his family have a way to return to the ER after discharge 7. The family lives a distance of less than 30 minutes drive from the center of Emergency Medicine 8. The baby lives in an environment with no smoking 9. The baby's family is available by phone 10. The baby's family is ready for continuous monitoring of the baby at home 11th. Disease severity index (RDSS) of < 4 (see definitions)', 'exclusion_criteria': '1. Previous morbidity: cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular, nutrition (including FTT). And congenital or acquired airway problem. 2. Age since conception is less than -44 weeks. 3. History of apneas 4. Bacterial pneumonia suggested by a localized-focal finding on X-ray 5. Previous wheezing attack 6. O2 Saturation > 92% on room air 7. Family has no transportation available follow-up visits 8. The family lives at a distance greater than 30 minutes drive from the medical facility 9. The baby was treated with steroids for this attack 10. There is no continuous monitoring of the baby at home', 'brief_summary': 'Background: acute bronchiolitis (AB) is a common reason for hospitalization of infants in all population groups, and is usually due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The main cause for hospitalization is often a need for oxygen, but can also include high fever (with a suspected secondary bacterial infection) or increasing respiratory distress. In a minority of cases (some of which can be identified in advance by defining risk groups) a serious illness may develop, including risk of respiratory failure and death. Most cases will just require supplemental oxygen and suction of secretions from the nose (as listed in the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics - AAP). However, this apparently \"simple\" treatment still requires continued hospitalization. This results in a sharp increase in bed occupancy in Israeli hospital pediatric departments in the winter months. In recent years two studies from developed countries have been published where safety has been demonstrated for home oxygen treatment for babies with AB. However, feasibility studies have not been published yet, for example for populations living in poor conditions. The General Health Services (Klalit) in Israel provides integrated hospital and community health service to the majority of the population living o in our region, thus presenting an opportunity for optimal interventions related to this disease.', 'detailed_description': 'Objective: To develop a model of community based safe handling of AB in various communities in southern Israel. Methods: A prospective intervention study examining the safety and health expenditures in infants with AB treated first in hospital but then discharged earlier with home oxygen while monitored in the community. Contribution to the focus areas, and the impact of results on health policy planning: 1) Reducing hospitalization days and general financial savings. 2) Ability to implement these findings to populations with variable socio-economic backgrounds. 3) Prevention of nosocomial infections related morbidity. Innovation and uniqueness in the study: test of this hypothesis precisely in our region, where populations have different socio-economic backgrounds, will build a model that may be suitable for all levels of society.'}   \n",

benefits and risks of antipyretics use in naturally occurring influenza virus infections in humans.', 'detailed_description': 'Background: Being one of the commonest conditions encountered in modern medical practice, fever is commonly regarded as an illness that has to be treated, both by medical professionals and patients. However, objective and convincing evidence is lacking that naturally occurring fever is harmful, and there is growing evidence that fever may serve an important host defense mechanism in infections and the risks of its suppression may far outweigh its apparent benefits. In acute respiratory infections including influenza, antipyretics are commonly being prescribed as a symptomatic treatment. Evidence from different randomized controlled trials, however, had challenged the actual amount of clinical benefit achievable by fever suppression for improving the patients' comfort and behavior. On the other hand, evidence from animal and human challenge studies has suggested that antipyretic therapy may actually prolong the duration of illness, suppress humoral antibody response, and increase the level and duration of viral shedding. The knowledge gap: Most of the currently available evidence on the harms and benefits of antipyretic treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are from either experimental animal studies, or human challenge studies with various respiratory viruses, or from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on patients with fever of presumed viral origin. There has yet been no RCT that has investigated on the effect of antipyretics on the clinical course, disease duration, and the pattern of viral shedding in naturally occurring acute URTIs of viral origin in humans. Whereas acute URTIs can be caused by a range of viral and non-viral causes, influenza virus infection is one of its leading cause, and its pathogenesis is relatively well understood compared to some other respiratory viruses. Aim: To investigate the potential benefits and risks of antipyretic use in naturally occurring influenza virus infections in humans. Design and subjects: The study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Four hundred young adults aged 18-30 years will be recruited when they present with symptoms of acute respiratory infection within 48 hours of symptoms onset to university health clinics, and being tested positive with a QuickVue rapid influenza test. They will receive their clinical consultation and prescriptions as indicated as usual, and being randomized to receive either paracetamol or placebo, and given back-up NSAID for intolerable fever when required. Blood specimen, nasal and throat swabs will be collected on the same day (day 1). They will be followed-up on day 4, day 7 and day 10 for further collection of nasal and throat swabs, and on day 28 for a final blood taking. A symptom diary will be kept by each participant for 10 days for monitoring the clinical course of the infection. Potential significance: This will be the first RCT to investigate the effect of antipyretics on the clinical course, disease duration, and the pattern of viral shedding in naturally occurring influenza virus infection in humans. Findings from this study will have important contribution to our understanding on the role of fever as a host defense mechanism, and help to inform the appropriate clinical management approach in human influenza virus infection.'}   \n",

Secondary Aims: 1. Describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacteria at presentation. 2. Investigate the depression, anxiety and stress scores (DASS21) and quality of life scored (QOL) by parents of the children during admission, pre-discharge and post discharge and at follow-ups.', 'detailed_description': 'Introduction: Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in children less than 5 years old and these are preventable deaths.[1,2] It is also an important cause of morbidity , especially when it is recurrent or severe as it may be linked with future adult lung disease.[3] Determining the aetiology of pneumonia is difficult in children who cannot produce satisfactory sputum for culture. Hence the reliance on molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Enzyme immunoassays(EIA) looking at serological rise to determine the true aetiology of pneumonia is important especially in the era where mixed infections are common and may be associated with severe infections. There is currently no information on the suitable duration of antibiotics for uncomplicated severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is also rampant overuse of antibiotics that results in poor compliance and significant side effects. There is little information on the QOL of the child with severe pneumonia and his parent. It is important to have a holistic approach to medicine hence the importance of analyzing the burden and social issues associated with children admitted with pneumonia. As opposed to adults, children cannot produce sputum (lower respiratory sample) appropriate for culture which is the traditional method of identifying the causative bacteria. Identification of bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (upper respiratory sample) does not equate to that organism causing the infection as the upper airway of a child is often colonized by bacteria. Detecting the organism in blood identifies it as the causative organism. However, blood culture has a very low yield in children with pneumonia and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is much more sensitive at detecting bacteria in blood and hence it will markedly improve the ability to determine infecting organism. Development of our own in-house bacterial PCR kit which will detect several different bacteria in blood is planned in this study. We already have an in-house viral PCR kit and the ability to detect atypical bacteria via EIA. Currently there is an international study (Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health [PERCH]) looking at aetiology of pneumonia, but this study only involves 2 Asian countries (Thailand and Bangladesh)[5]. In Malaysia, in 2011 there was a study that looked at pneumococcal isolates and antibiotic sensitivity patterns on invasive pneumococcal disease only[6]. There are also studies that look at viral aetiology of pneumonia[7]. Hence information on aetiology of pneumonia is skewed to those involving vaccine associated organisms and use of nasopharyngeal secretions(NPS) to detect viruses.. The evidence for appropriate duration of antibiotics that should be used in hospitalized children with pneumonia is scarce. A randomized controlled trial comparing traditional duration of antibiotics (>= 7 days) versus shorter duration of antibiotics < 7 days) is what we think is necessary. There are no studies looking at duration of antibiotics in children with severe uncomplicated pneumonia. We hypothesize that there is no need for a longer duration of antibiotics which are only associated with poor compliance and unnecessary side-effects. Finally, there is little data on quality of life in children and parents during and after a pneumonic episode. It is important to measure the impact of such a common disease on both parent and patient as well as to assess the impact of medical management on QOL so as to have a more holistic approach to medicine. Two previous studies have looked at QOL. One was a study comparing all acute diseases to chronic diseases[8]. The other looked at CAP but without the use of structured questionnaires[9] Methodology Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial Children aged 3 months till <5 years old Admitted to University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) hospital with a severe community acquired pneumonia Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: 3 Months to 59 Months Genders Eligible for Study: Both Inclusion Criteria: Children admitted with severe pneumonia as defined by the presence of all the following as defined as below: - 3 months to 59 months old - History of cough and/or shortness of breath Unwell for <= 7 days - Increased respiratory rate ( >= 50/min if <=12 months old, >= 40/min) - Any of the following signs/symptoms are present at examination that would necessitate admission: chest retractions, cyanosis, saturation< 92% on air, poor feeding or lethargy - Documented fever (axillary /central temp >= 38/38.5°C) within 24 hrs of admission - Abnormal chest radio graph(CXR) with presence of alveolar infiltrates - Responds to IV antibiotics by the first 72 hrs and able to go home with oral antibiotics i.e. no more hypoxia and afebrile and reduced respiratory symptoms Exclusion Criteria: Children who (a) are transferred from another hospital (b) refuse blood taking (c) have a doctor diagnosis of asthma or recurrent wheezing illness (d) have a diagnosis of bronchiolitis i.e. wheezing in a child with a CXR with no consolidation (e) do not have an acute illness ( ie >7 days) (f) are unable to come for follow-up (g) do not have community acquired pneumonia e.g. aspiration pneumonia (h)have a complicated pneumonia with effusion, pneumothorax, clinical suspicion of necrotizing pneumonia (i)require paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission or use of non-invasive ventilation (j)significant comorbidities that can increase the risk of having a complicated pneumonia- (k) need other antibiotics like anti-staph or macrolides (l)have an extra-pulmonary infection e.g. meningitis (m)are allergic to penicillin (n) are unable to tolerate oral antibiotics and (o)have underlying illness that can predispose to recurrent pneumonia Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial Children aged 3 months till <5 years old Admitted to UMMC hospital with a severe community acquired pneumonia Informed signed consent will be obtained from parents first. All children will have full blood count and CXR taken Additional blood and urine as detailed below will also be taken: a. Blood for PCR -streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pnuemoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae will be taken. NPS for respiratory bacteria and viruses (by culture and PCT-similar as above) All these samples will be tested in our hospital laboratory. If samples cannot be processed immediately, they will be stored in a -80 deg C freezer except for the NPS for bacterial culture. All data will be collected at enrollment and at each follow-up visit on a standardized data sheet. Baseline demographic data( age, gender, address, ethnicity, household size, income, parent education, caregivers, household appliances) and medical information( birth history, breastfeeding and weaning, growth, immunization, smoke exposure, co-morbidity, daily hospitalization information) will be obtained from parents and medical charts. CXRs and routine blood test results will also be recorded. Quality of life, stress level, severity of illness , of parents and children with pneumonia, will be assessed at these time points too: during their admission (average of 3-5 days) and during follow-ups( average at, 4 weeks, 3 months(phone call only with no questionnaire administered), 6 months, 1 year post their pneumonic episode) using the following questionnaires-Paediatric proxy cough quality of life-8 (PCQOL-8), Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu Scale (CARIFS) (in hospital only), cough diary( at home, daily for 1 month),Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21( DASS21). The PCQOL-8 and DASS21 have been translated and validated in Bahasa Melayu. The CARIFS and the cough diary was recently translated in Bahasa Melayu and piloted for the purpose of this study. Treatments will be administered only after at least 48-72 hrs of intravenous(IV) antibiotics ( penicillin/ampicillin/ amoxicillin-clavulanate acid/cefuroxime) and the patients are ready for discharge : afebrile, improved respiratory symptoms and signs, saturation > 92% in air and ready to be converted to oral antibiotics. Arm 1: Twice a day oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (22.5mg/kg/dose) for 10 days Arm 2: Twice a day oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (22.5mg/kg/dose) for 3 days followed by oral placebo for 7 days The random treatments will be allocated via computer generated number sequence and will be supervised by a statistician. All medications will be prepared and dispensed by the pharmacy department in suspension form. The appearance of the placebo will be similar to the active medication. Investigators and subjects will be blinded. At discharge, parents will be asked to fill up a daily cough diary at home. Treatment failure/exit criteria will be fulfilled if any of the following occur: death, recrudescence of fever >=38 °C (axilla) with respiratory signs of pneumonia, hypoxaemia < 92% on air), need for antibiotic treatment, new CXR changes. On discharge, children will be followed up at regular intervals of 4 weeks, 3 moths(phone call), 6 months and 1 year, to ensure they are well and also to detect residual or recurring respiratory symptoms i.e. presence of cough/breathlessness/fever, recrudescence of pneumonia and other respiratory illness, fever and upper respiratory tract infection(URTI), growth, need for unscheduled healthcare visits for respiratory symptoms, need for antibiotic treatments for respiratory/upper airway symptoms, abnormal physical findings, over a period of 1 year post-discharge from hospital. Adverse effects of antibiotics e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and adherence (returned empty bottles) to medication will be recorded. CXR will be repeated at 4 weeks and at 1 year(if clinically indicated). These will be scored by a radiologist who will be masked to allotted treatment. At 12 months, if the age allows it, children will be asked to perform lung function tests. During these follow-ups they will be given questionnaires: PCQOL-8, DASS21. At the 4 week discharge, CXR as well as blood and NPS will be collected for testing for bacterial and viral organisms. At 4 weeks, daily cough diaries will be collected back and reviewed. Sample size calculation is based on the primary aim. We expect a 20% superiority difference in the extended antibiotic regime and assuming a 20% drop-out, sample size should be 204 children (102 in each arm). Data will be presented in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines on reporting on RCTs. Analysis will be done by Dr. Rafdzah, a statistician. An intention to treat approach will be used for all analyses. For the primary aim i.e. the clinical outcome of the different antibiotic durations, the main outcomes being looked at are (a) clinical cure-complete resolution of symptoms and signs at 4 weeks ,(b) proportion of children without chronic respiratory symptoms or signs at the 12 month follow-up , using odds ratio(95%CI) with logistic regression and linear regression. For continuous variables, t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests will be used depending on the normality of the data. A Kaplan-Meier curve will be constructed for each group for the time to next respiratory illness and hospitalization and proportions will be compared by regression models. For prevalence of respiratory pathogens, point prevalence will be reported on and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for baseline carriage and antibiotic resistance will examine the effects of treatment duration on the different organisms particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and Staph aureus.'}   \n",
