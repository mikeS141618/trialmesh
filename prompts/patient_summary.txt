==== USER PROMPT ====

    I need a structured summary of the following cancer patient record for clinical trial matching purposes.

    Patient Record:
    """
    {patient_text}
    """

    Extract and organize the key clinical information into these EXACT sections:

    DIAGNOSIS:
    • List each cancer diagnosis chronologically with dates
    • Include precise staging (TNM if available), grade, and anatomical location
    • Note histological subtype and any important pathology findings

    BIOMARKERS:
    • List all genomic alterations with specific mutations (e.g., BRAF V600E, EGFR exon 19 deletion)
    • Include biomarker expression levels with values when available (e.g., PD-L1 80%, HER2 3+)
    • Note testing methods and dates if mentioned

    TREATMENT HISTORY:
    • Chronological list of cancer therapies with start/end dates
    • Include specific regimens, doses if mentioned
    • Document response assessments (CR, PR, SD, PD) and duration
    • Note reason for discontinuation (progression, toxicity, completion)

    RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY:
    • Major comorbidities that could impact trial eligibility
    • Organ function issues (cardiac, hepatic, renal)
    • Prior surgeries or radiation treatments
    • Significant adverse events to previous treatments

    CURRENT STATUS:
    • Current ECOG/KPS performance status
    • Active symptoms and disease burden
    • Most recent disease assessment and progression status
    • Current laboratory values relevant to trial eligibility

    Focus ONLY on information explicitly stated in the record. Use bullet points for clarity. Do not infer or add details not present in the original text. If information for a section is not available, write "Not specified in record."
